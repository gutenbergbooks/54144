<h2 id="c1">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Under the title of the New Forest I have thought it best to
include the whole district lying between the Southampton Water
and the Avon, which, in the beginning of Edward I.&rsquo;s reign,
formed its boundaries. To have restricted myself to its present
limits would have deprived the reader of all the scenery along
the coast, and that contrast which a Forest requires to bring
out all its beauties.</p>
<p>The maps are drawn from those of the Ordnance Survey,
reduced to the scale of half an inch to the mile, with the
additions of the names of the woods taken from the Government
Map of the Forest, and my own notes.</p>
<p>The illustrations have been made upon the principle that
they shall represent the scene as it looked at the time it was
taken. Nothing has since been added, nothing left out. The
views appear as they were on the day they were drawn. Two
exceptions occur. The ugly modern windows of Calshot Castle,
and the clock-face on the tower of the Priory Church of Christchurch,
have been omitted.</p>
<p>Further, the views have been chosen rather to show the
less-known beauties of the Forest than the more-known scenes.
For this reason the avenue between Brockenhurst and Lyndhurst&mdash;the
village of Minestead, nestling half amongst the
Forest oaks and half in its own orchards&mdash;the view from Stoney
Cross, stretching over wood and vale to the Wiltshire downs,
have been omitted. Every one who comes to the Forest must
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
see these, and every one with the least love for Nature must
feel their beauty.</p>
<p>In their places are given the quiet scenes in the heart of
the great woods, where few people have the leisure, and some
not the strength to go&mdash;quiet brooks flowing down deep valleys,
and woodland paths trod only by the cattle and the Forest
workmen.</p>
<p>For the same reason, sunrise, and not sunset, has been
chosen for the frontispiece.</p>
<p>To the kind help of friends I am indebted for much special
aid and information&mdash;to the deputy surveyor, L. H. Cumberbatch,
Esq., for permission to open various barrows and banks,
for the use of the Government maps, as also for the Forest
statistics&mdash;to the Rev. H. M. Wilkinson, and T. B. Rake, Esq.,
for great assistance in the botany and ornithology of the
district; as also to Mr. Baker, of Brockenhurst, for the list
of the Forest Lepidoptera.</p>

<p>No person, I suppose, would now give any attention to, much
less approve of, Lord Burleigh&rsquo;s advice to his son&mdash;&ldquo;Not to pass
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the Alps.&rdquo; We have, on the contrary, in these days gone into
an opposite extreme. We race off to explore the Rhine before
we know the Thames. We have Alpine clubs, and Norway
fishing, and Iceland exploring societies, but most of us are
beyond measure ignorant of our own hills and valleys. Every
inch of Mont Blanc has been traversed by Englishmen, but who
dreams of exploring the Cotswolds; or how many can tell in
what county are the Seven Springs, and their purple anemones?
We rush to and fro, looking at everything, and remembering
nothing. We see places only that we may be seen there, or else
be known to have seen them.</p>
<p>Yet to Englishmen, surely the scenes of their own land
should possess a greater interest than any other. Go where we
will throughout England, there is no spot which is not bound
up with our history. Nameless barrows, ruined castles, battlefields
now reaped by the sickle instead of the sword, all proclaim
the changes our country has undergone. Each invasion which
we have suffered, each revolution through which we have passed,
are written down for us in unmistakeable characters. The
phases of our Religion, the rise or fall of our Art, are alike told
us by the grey mouldings and arches of the humblest parish
Church as by our Abbeys and Cathedrals. The faces, too, and
gait, and dialect, and accent, of our peasantry declare to us
our common ancestry from Kelt, and Old-English, and Norseman.
A whole history lies hid in the name of some obscure
village.</p>
<p>I am not, for one moment, decrying travelling elsewhere.
All I say is, that those who do not know their own country,
can know nothing rightly of any other. To understand the
scenery of our neighbours, we must first see something of the
beauties of our own; so that when we are abroad, we may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
able to make some comparisons,&mdash;to carry with us, when we look
upon the valleys of the Seine and the Rhine, some impression
of our own landscapes and our own rivers&mdash;some recollection of
our own cathedrals, when we stand by those of Milan and
Rouen.</p>
<p>The New Forest is, perhaps, as good an example as could
be wished of what has been said of English scenery, and its
connection with our history. It remains after some eight
hundred years still the New Forest. True, its boundaries are
smaller, but the main features are the same as on the day
when first afforested by the Conqueror. The names of its woods
and streams and plains are the same. It is almost the last,
too, of the old forests with which England was formerly so
densely clothed. Charnwood is now without its trees: Wychwood
is enclosed: the great Forest of Arden&mdash;Shakspeare&rsquo;s
Arden&mdash;is no more, and Sherwood is only known by the fame
of Robin Hood. But the New Forest still stands full of old
associations with, and memories of, the past. To the historian
it tells of the Forest Laws, and the death of one of the worst,
and the weakness of the most foolish, of English kings. To
the ecclesiologist it can show, close to it, the Priory Church
of Christchurch, with all its glories of Norman architecture,
built by the Red King&rsquo;s evil counsellor, Flambard; and just
outside, too, its boundaries, the Conventual Church of Romsey,
with its lovely Romanesque triforium, in whose nunnery
Edith, beloved by the English, their &ldquo;good Maud,&rdquo; &ldquo;beatissima
regina,&rdquo; as the Chroniclers love to call her, was
educated.</p>
<p>At its feet lies Southampton, with its Late Norman arcaded
town-wall, and gates, and God&rsquo;s House, with memories of Sir
Bevis and his wife Josyan the Brighte, and his horse Arundel&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
port for the Roman triremes, and afterwards for the
galleys of Venice and Bayonne&mdash;where our own Henry V.
built</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;the grete dromons,</p>
<p class="t0">The Trinit&eacute;, the Grace-Dieu.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Within it, once in the very heart, stand the Abbot&rsquo;s house
and the cloister walls of Beaulieu, the one abbey, with the
exception of Hales-Owen, in Shropshire, founded by John. It
can point, too, to the Roman camp at Buckland Rings, to the
ruins of the Norman castle at Christchurch, to Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
forts at Hurst and Calshot, built with the stones of the ruined
monastery of Beaulieu; can show, too, bosomed amongst its
trees, quiet village churches, most of them Norman and Early
English, old manor-houses, as at Ellingham, famous in story,
grey roadside crosses, sites of Roman potteries, and Keltic and
West-Saxon battlefields and barrows scattered over its plains.</p>
<p>For the ornithologist its woods, and rivers, and seaboard
attract more birds than most counties. For the geologist the
Middle-Eocene beds are always open in the Hordle and
Barton Cliffs inlaid with shell and bone. For the botanist and
entomologist, its marshes, moors, and woodlands, possess equal
treasures.</p>
<p>But in its wild scenery lies its greatest charm. From every
hill-top gleam the blue waters of the English Channel, broken
in the foreground by the long line of the Isle of Wight downs
and the white chalk walls of the Needles. Nowhere, in extent at
least, spread such stretches of heath and moor, golden in the
spring with the blaze of furze, and in the autumn purple with
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
heather, and bronzed with the fading fern. Nowhere in England
rise such oak-woods, their boughs rimed with the frostwork
of lichens, and dark beech-groves with their floor of red brown
leaves, on which the branches weave their own warp and woof
of light and shade.</p>
<p>Especially to its scenery I would call attention. This, above
all, I wish to impress on the reader, seeing that beauty is
one of the chief ends and aims of nature: and that the ground
beneath our feet is decked with flowers, and the sky above our
heads is painted, with a thousand colours, to cheer man as he
goes to his work in the morning, and to fill his heart with
thankfulness as he returns at evening.</p>
<p>Now, neither are scarcely ever seen. The flowers cannot
grow in our stony streets: the glory of the morning and
evening is blotted out by the fog of smoke which broods over
our cities.</p>
<p>As the population grows, our commons and waste lands
disappear. Our large towns have swollen into provinces.
Fashion sways the rich. Necessity compels the poor to live in
them. As our wealth increases, our love for nature contracts.
One, therefore, of the chief objects of this book is to show how
much quiet beauty and how much interest lie beside our doors&mdash;to,
point out to the reader who may be jaded by the toils of
Fashion or Labour where in England there are still some thirty
miles of moorland and woodland left uncultivated, over which
he can wander as he pleases.</p>
<p>And here, if this book should induce any readers to visit
the Forest, let me earnestly advise them to do so, as far as
possible, on foot. I see but this main difference between rich
and poor&mdash;that the poor work to get money, the rich spend
money to get work. And I know no better way for Englishmen
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
to use their superfluous energies than in learning their own
country by walking over its best scenes.</p>
<p>I will only ask any one to make the experiment between
walking and driving over the same ground; and see how much
he will learn by the one, how much lose by the other method.
In the one case, he simply hurries or stops, at the discretion
of some ignorant driver, who regards him of less importance
than his horses; in the other, he can pause to sketch many
a scene before invisible, can at his leisure search each heath
or quarry for flowers or fossils, can turn aside across the field-paths
to any village church, or wander through any wood which
may invite him to its solitude, and, above all, know the pleasure
of being tired, and the sweetness of rest in the noontide shade.</p>

</div>
<p>As I said in the last chapter, one of the main objects of this
book is to dwell upon the beauty of the Forest scenery. I
chose the New Forest as a subject, because, although in some
points it may not be more beautiful than many other parts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
England&mdash;and I am glad to think so,&mdash;it gives, more than any
other place, a far greater range of subject, in sea, and moor, and
valley; because too, the traveller can here go where he pleases,
without any of those lets and hindrances which take away so
much pleasure; and, lastly, because here can best be seen
Nature&rsquo;s crown of glory&mdash;her woods.</p>
<p>And, first, for a few words of general bearing upon this
point. I do not think we ever estimate the woods highly
enough, ever know their real worth, until we find some favourite
retreat levelled to the ground, and then feel the void and irreparable
blankness which is left. Consider, too, the purposes to
which Nature turns her woods, either softening the horrors of the
precipice, or adorning spaces which else would be utterly without
interest, or adding beauty to beauty. Consider, further, how
she beguiles us when we are in them, leading us forward, each
little rise appearing a hill, because we cannot see its full extent;
how, too, the paths close behind us, shutting us out with their
silent doorways from all noise and turmoil, whilst the soft green
light fills every dim recess, and deepens each pillared aisle, the
floor paved with the golden mosaic of the sunlight.</p>
<p>Consider not only their beauty, but their use, breaking, for
the plants, the fall of winter showers, and storing for them,
against summer&rsquo;s drought, their wealth of springs and streams&mdash;giving
to the cattle shade from the heat, and shelter from the
storm. This for the plants and beasts of the field,&mdash;but for
man, binding together the sandy shore, carrying off the fog
and miasma from the marsh, raising the strongest bulwark
against the sea, and truest shield against the pestilence.</p>
<p>For all these things is it that the woods have been, since the
beginning of the world, the haunt of the flowers, the home of
the birds, and the temple of man. The haunt of the flowers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
I say, for in the early spring, before the grass is yet green in the
meadows, here they all flock&mdash;white wood-anemones, sweet
primroses, sweeter violets, and hyacinths encircling each stem
with their blue wreaths. The home of the birds; for when the
leaves at last have come, each tree is filled with song, and the
underwood with the first faint chirping of the nestlings learning
their earliest notes. As a temple for man, have they not been
so since the world began? Taught by their tender beauty, and
subdued by their solemn gloom, the imaginative Greek well
consecrated each grove and wood to some Divinity. The early
Christians fled to &ldquo;the armour of the house of the Forest,&rdquo; to
escape to peace and quietness. Here the old Gothic builders
first learnt how to rear their vaulted arches, and to wreathe their
pillars with stone arabesques of leaves and flowers, in faint
imitation of a beauty they might feel, but never reach.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Consider, too, the loveliness of all tree-forms, from the birch
and weeping-willow, which never know the slightest formality,
even when in winter barest of leaves, to the oak with its sinewy
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
boughs, strained and tortured as they are in this very Forest, as
nowhere else in England, by the Channel winds.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Consider,
too, Nature&rsquo;s own love and tenderness for her trees,&mdash;how, when
they have grown old and are going to decay, she clothes them
with fresh beauty, hides their deformities with a soft green veil of
moss and the grey dyes of lichens, and, not even content with
this, makes them the support for still greater loveliness&mdash;drapes
them with masses of ivy, and hangs upon them the tresses of
the woodbine, loading them to the end of their days with sweetness
and beauty.</p>
<p>All this, and far more than this, you may see in the commonest
woods round Lyndhurst, in Sloden, in Mark Ash, or
Bratley.</p>
<p>Then, too, there is that perpetual change which is ever going
on, every shower and gleam of sunshine tinting the trees with
colour from the tender tones of April and May, through the
deep green of June, to the russet-red of autumn. Each season
ever joins in this sweet conspiracy to oppress the woods with
loveliness.</p>
<p>Taking, however, a more special view, and looking at the
district itself, we must remember that it is situated on the
Middle-Eocene, and presents some of the best features of
the Tertiary formation. Its hills may not be high, but they
nowhere sink into tameness, whilst round Fordingbridge, and
Goreley, and Godshill, they resemble, in degree, with their
treeless, rounded forms, shaggy with heath and the rough sedge
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the fern, parts of the half-mountainous scenery near the
Fifeshire Lomonds.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>On the sea-coast near Milton, rise high gravel-capped cliffs,
with a basis of Barton clays, cleft by deep ravines, locally known
as &ldquo;bunnies.&rdquo; Inland, valleys open out, dipping between low
hills, whilst masses of beech and oak darken the plains. Here
and there, marking the swamps, gleam white patches of
cotton-grass, whilst round them, on the uplands, spread long,
unbroken stretches of purple heather; and wide spaces of fern,
an English Brabant, studded with hollies and yews, some of
them as old as the Conquest. Here and there, too, as at
Fritham, small farmsteads show their scanty crops of corn, or,
as at Alum Green and Queen&rsquo;s North, green lawns pierce and
separate the woods, pastured by herds of cattle, with forest pools
white with buckbean, and the little milkwort waving its blue
heath on the banks.</p>
<p>These are the main characteristics of the New Forest, and,
in some points at least, were the same in the days of the Red
King. Nature, when left to herself, even in the course of
centuries, changes little. The wild boars, and the wolves, and
the red deer, are gone. But much else is the same. The
sites and the names of the Forest manors and villages, with
slight alterations, remain unchanged. The same barrows still
uplift their rounded forms on the plains; the same banks, the
same entrenchments, near which, in turn, lived Kelt, and
Roman and Old-English, still run across the hills and valleys.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
The same churches rear their towers, and the mills still stand
by the same streams.</p>
<p>The peasants, too, still value the woods, as they did in the
Conqueror&rsquo;s time, for the crop of mast and acorns,&mdash;still peel off
the Forest turf, and cure their bacon by its smoke.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The
charcoal-burner still builds the same round ovens as in the days
of William the Red. Old-English words, to be heard nowhere
else, are daily spoken. The last of the old Forest law-courts
is held every forty days at Lyndhurst. The bee-master&mdash;<i>beoceorl</i>&mdash;still
tends his hives, and brews the Old-English mead, and
lives by the labours of his bees. The honey-buzzard still makes
her nest in the beeches round Lyndhurst, and the hen-harrier on
the moors near Bratley.</p>
<p>I suppose this is what strikes most persons when they first
come into the New Forest,&mdash;a sense that amidst all the change
which is going forward, here is one place which is little altered.
This is what gives it its greatest charm,&mdash;the beauty of wildness
and desolateness, broken by glimpses of cultivated fields, and
the smoke of unseen homesteads among the woods.</p>
<p>Yet the feeling is not quite true. Like every other place
in England, it has suffered some change, and moved with the
times. Instead of the twang of the archer&rsquo;s bow, the sunset
gun at Portsmouth sounds every evening. The South-Western
Railway runs through the heart of it; and in place of the
curfew&rsquo;s knell, the steam whistle shrieks through its woods.</p>
<p>We do not see the Forest of our forefathers. Go back eight
centuries, and look at the sights which the Normans must
have beheld,&mdash;dense underwoods of hollies on which the red
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
deer browsed; masses of beech and chestnut, the haunts of the
wolf and the boar; plains over which flocks of bustards
half-ran, half-flew; swamps where the crane in the sedge laid
its buff and crimson-streaked eggs; whilst above grey-headed
kites swam in circles; and round the coast the sea-eagle slowly
flapped its heavy bulk. Great oaks, shorn flat by the Channel
winds, fringed the high Hordle cliffs, towering above the sea;
and opposite, as to this day, rose the white chalk rocks of
the Needles, and the Isle of Wight, where at Watchingwell
stretched another forest of the King&rsquo;s. And the sun would set
as it now does, but upon all this further beauty, making a broad
path of glory across the bay, till at last it sank down over
the Priory Church of Christchurch, which Flambard was then
building.</p>
<p>Gone, too, for ever all the scenes which they must have had
of the Avon, glimpses of it caught among the trees as they
galloped through the broad lawns, or under the sides of Godshill,
and Castle Hill crested with yews and oaks.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>These may all be gone, but plenty of beauty is still left.
The Avon still flows on with its floating gardens of flowers&mdash;lilies
and arrowhead, and the loosestrife waving its crimson
plumes among the green reeds. The Forest streams, too, still
flow on the same, losing themselves in the woods, eddying round
and round in the deep, dark, prison-pools of their own making,
and then escaping over shallows and ledges of rolled pebbles,
left dry in the summer, and on which the sunlight rests, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the shadows of the beeches play, but in the winter chafed by
the torrent.</p>
<p>Across its broad expanse of moors the sun still sets the
same in summer time&mdash;into some deep bank of clouds in the
west, and as it plunges down, flashes of light run along their
edges, and each thin band of vapour becomes a bar of fire, and
the far-away Purbeck hills gleam with purple and amethyst.</p>
<p>The same sea, too, still heaves and tosses beneath the
Hordle and Barton Cliffs, with the same dark patches, shadows
of clouds, sailing over it, as its waves, along the shore, unroll
their long scrolls of foam.</p>
<p>These great natural facts have not changed. Kelt and
Roman have gone, but these are the same.</p>
<p>Nor must I forget the extraordinary lovely atmospheric
effects, noticed also by Gilpin,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> as seen, under certain conditions,
from the Barton Cliffs on the Isle of Wight and the Needles.
Far out at sea will rise a low white fog-bank gradually stealing
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
to the land, enveloping some stray ship in its folds, and then
by degrees encircling the Island, whilst the chalk cliffs melt into
clouds. On it still steals with its thick mist, quenching the
Needles Light which has been lit, till the whole island is
capped with fog, and neither sea nor sky is seen,&mdash;nothing but
a dense haze blotting everything. Then suddenly the wind lifts
the great cloud westward, and its black curtains drop away,
revealing a sky of the deepest blue, barred with lines of light:
and the whole bay suddenly shines out clear and glittering,
the Island cliffs flashing with opal and emerald, and the ship
once more glides out safe from the darkness.</p>
<p>A few words, too, must be said about the two principal tree-forms
which now make the Forest. The oaks here do not grow
so high or so large as in many other parts of England, but they
are far finer in their outlines, hanging in the distance as if
rather suspended in the air than growing from the earth, but
nearer, as especially at Bramble Hill, twisting their long arms,
and interlacing each other into a thick roof. Now and then
they take to straggling ways, running out, as with the famous
Knyghtwood Oak, into mere awkward forks. The most striking
are not, perhaps, so much those in their prime, as the old ruined
trees at Boldrewood, their bark furrowed with age, their timber
quite decayed, now only braced together by the clamps of ivy to
which they once gave support and strength.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The beeches are even finer, and more characteristic, though
here and there a tree sometimes resembles the oaks, as if with
long living amongst them, it had learnt to grow like them. The
finest beech-wood is that of Mark Ash. There you may see true
beech-forms, the boles spangled with silver scales of lichen, and
the roots&mdash;more fangs than roots&mdash;grasping the earth, feathered
with the soft green down of moss.</p>
<p>But not in individual trees lies the beauty of the Forest, but
in the masses of wood. There, in the long aisles, settles that
depth of shade which no pencil can give, and that colouring
which no canvas can retain, as the sunlight pierces through the
green web of leaves, flinging, as it sets, a crown of gold round
each tree-trunk.</p>
<p>Let no one, however, think they know anything of the
Forest by simply keeping to the high road and the beaten tracks.
They must go into it, across the fern and the heather, and, if
necessary, over the swamps, into such old woods as Barrow&rsquo;s
Moor, Mark Ash, Bushey Bratley, and Oakley, wandering at
their own will among the trees. The best advice which I can
give to see the Forest is to follow the course of one of its
streams, to make it your friend and companion, and go wherever
it goes. It will be sure to take you through the greenest
valleys, and past the thickest woods, and under the largest trees.
No step along with it is ever lost, for it never goes out of its
way but in search of some fresh beauty.</p>
<p>We see plenty of pictures in our Exhibitions from Burnham
Beeches or Epping Forest, but in the New Forest the artist will
find not only woodland, but sea, and moorland, and river views.
There are, as I have said, when taken in details, more beautiful
spots in England, but none so characteristic. Finer trees,
wilder moors, higher hills, more swiftly-flowing brooks, may
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
be found, but nowhere that quietness so typical of English
scenery, yet mixed with wildness, nowhere so much combined
in one.</p>
<p>I say, too, this, strange as it may doubtless appear, that
Government, whenever it fells any timber, should spare some
of the finest trees for the sake of their beauty, and for the
delight they will give to future generations. Cut down, and sawn
into planks, they are worth but so many pounds. Standing,
their value is inappreciable. We have Government Schools of
Design, and Government Picture Galleries, but they are useless
without Nature to assist the student. Government, by keeping
here some few old trees, will do more to foster true Art than
all the grants of Parliament. The old thorns of Bratley, the
beeches of Mark Ash, and the yews of Sloden, will teach more
than all the schools and galleries in the world. As we have laws
to preserve our partridges and pheasants, surely we might have
some to protect our trees and our landscapes.</p>
<p>Lastly, from its very nature, the New Forest is ever beautiful,
at every season of the year, even in the depth of winter. The
colouring of summer is not more rich. Then the great masses
of holly glisten with their brightest green; the purple light
gathers round the bare oaks, and the yews stand out in their
shrouds of black. Then the first budding branch of furze
sparkles with gold, and the distant hill-side glows with the
red layers of beech-leaves. And if a snow-storm passes up
from the sea, then every bough is suddenly covered with a silver
filigree of whitest moss.</p>
<p>This joyful tyranny of beauty is ever present, at all times and
hours, changeful in form, but the same in essence. Year after
year, day after day, it appears.</p>
<p>I know, however, it is impossible to make people see this
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
beauty, which, after all, exists only in each beholder&rsquo;s mind.
No two people see the same thing, and no person ever sees it
twice. But, I believe, we may all gain some idea of the glory
which each season brings&mdash;some glimpses of the heaven of
beauty which ever surrounds us&mdash;if we will seek for them
patiently and reverently. They cannot with some be learnt
at once, but, in degrees, are attainable by all; but they are
attainable only upon this one condition,&mdash;that we go to Nature
with a docile, loving spirit, without which nothing can be learnt.
If we go with any other feeling, we had much better stay in a
town amidst the congenial smoke, than profane Nature with the
pride of ignorance and the insolence of condescension.</p>

<p>Once the New Forest occupied nearly the entire south-west
angle of Hampshire, stretching, when at its largest, in the
beginning of the reign of Edward I., from the Southampton
Water on the east, whose waves, the legend says, reproved
the courtiers of Canute, to the Avon, and even, here and there,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
across it, on the west; and on the north from the borders of
Wiltshire to the English Channel.</p>
<p>These natural boundaries were, as we shall see, reduced in
that same reign. Since then encroachments on all sides have
still further lessened its limits; and it now stretches, here and
there divided by manors and private property, on the north
from the village of Bramshaw, beyond Stoney Cross, near where
Rufus fell, or was supposed to fall, to Wootton on the south,
some thirteen miles; and, still further, from Hardley on the
east to Ringwood, the Rinwede of <i>Domesday</i>, on the west.</p>
<p>In the year 1079, just thirteen years after the battle of
Hastings, William ordered its afforestation. From Turner and
Lingard down to the latest compiler, our historians have represented
the act as one of the worst pieces of cruelty ever committed
by an English sovereign. Even Lappenberg calls the
site of the Forest &ldquo;the most thriving part of England,&rdquo; and
says that William &ldquo;mercilessly caused churches and villages
to be burnt down within its circuit;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> and, in another place,
speaks of the Conqueror&rsquo;s &ldquo;bloody sacrifice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;glaring
cruelty towards the numerous inhabitants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> To such statements
in ordinary writers we should pay no attention, but they
assume a very different aspect when put forward, especially in
so unqualified a way, by a historian to whom our respect and
attention are due. I have no wish to defend the character
of William. He was one of those men whose wills are strong
enough to execute the thoughts of their minds, ordained by
necessity to rule others, holding firmly to the creed that success
is the best apology for crime. Yet, too, he had noble qualities.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Abroad he was feared by the bad, whilst at home such order
prevailed throughout England, that a man might travel in safety
&ldquo;with his bosom full of gold&rdquo; from one end to the other.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>What I do here protest against is the common practice
of implicitly believing every tradition, of repeating every idle
story which has been foisted into the text either by credulity
or rancorous hatred&mdash;of, in fact, mistaking party feeling for
history. The Chroniclers had every reason to malign William.
His very position was enough. He had pressed with a heavy
hand on the Old-English nobles, stripped them of their lands,
their civil power, and their religious honours; and failing to
learn, had, like a second Attila, tried to uproot their language.</p>
<p>The truth is, we are so swayed by our feelings that the
most dispassionate writer is involuntarily biassed. We in fact
pervert truth without knowing we do so. Language, by its
very nature, betrays us. No historian, with the least vividness
of style, can copy from another without exaggeration. The
misplacement of a single word, the insertion of a single epithet,
gives a different colour and tone. And, in this very matter of
the New Forest, we need only take the various accounts, as they
have come down, to find in them the evidences of their own
untruth.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>I do not here enter into the question of William&rsquo;s right
to make the Forest&mdash;about this there can be no doubt&mdash;but
simply into the methods which he employed in its formation.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
The earliest Chronicler of the event, Gulielmus Gemeticensis,
who has been so often quoted in evidence of William&rsquo;s cruelty,
both because he was a Norman, and chaplain to the King, really
proves nothing. In the first place, the monk of Jumi&egrave;ges did
not write this account, but some successor, so that the argument
drawn from the writer&rsquo;s position falls to the ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> In the
second place, his successor&rsquo;s words are&mdash;&ldquo;Many, however, say
(<i>ferunt autem multi</i>) that the deaths of Rufus and his brother
were a judgment from heaven, because their father had destroyed
many villages and churches in enlarging (<i>amplificandam</i>) the
New Forest.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> The writer offers no comment of his own, and
simply passes over the matter, as not worth even refutation.
His narrative, however, if it tells at all, tells against the
common theory, as he states that William only extended the
limits of a former chase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The account of Florence of Worcester is, on the whole,
equally unsatisfactory. His mention of the New Forest, like
that, by the way, of most of the Chroniclers, does not occur
in its proper place at the date it was made&mdash;when the wrong, we
should have thought, must have been most felt&mdash;but is suggested
by the death of Rufus, when popular superstition had come
into play, and time had lent all the force of exaggeration to
what must always have been an unpopular event. Florence,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
however, speaks in general terms of men driven from their
homes, of fields laid waste, and houses and churches destroyed:
words which, as we shall see, carry their own contradiction.
Vitalis,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> too, not only declares that the district was thickly
inhabited, but that it even regularly supplied the markets of
Winchester, and that William laid in ruins no less than sixty
parishes. Walter Mapes,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> who flourished about the middle
of the twelfth century, adds further that thirty-six mother
churches were destroyed, but falls into the error of making
Rufus the author of the Forest, which of course materially
affects his evidence.</p>
<p>Knyghton,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> however, who lived in the reign of Richard II.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
is doubtful whether the number of churches destroyed was
twenty-two or fifty-two, an amount of difference so large that
we might also reasonably suspect his narrative, whilst he also
commits the mistake of attributing the formation of the Forest
to Rufus.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing which strikes us is that as the writers
are more distant in point of time, and therefore less capable
of knowing, they singularly enough become more precise and
specific. What Florence of Worcester speaks of in merely
general terms, Vitalis, and Walter Mapes, and Knyghton, give
in minute details down to the very number of the parishes
and churches.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>As far as mere written testimony goes, we have nothing to
set against their evidence, except <i>Domesday</i>, and the negative
proof of <i>The Chronicle</i>. Not one word does The Chronicler,
who, be it remembered, personally knew the Conqueror<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>&mdash;who
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
has related each minute event of his reign, exposed each shortcoming,
and branded each crime&mdash;say of the cruelty of the afforestation.
Evidence like this, coming from such an authority,
is in the highest degree important. The silence is most
suggestive. It is impossible to believe, that so faithful an
historian, had it been committed, should never have hinted
at the devastation of so much property, and the double crime
of cruelty and profanity in destroying alike the inhabitants and
their churches.</p>
<p>But the briefest analysis of <i>Domesday</i>, and a comparison
of its contents with those of the survey made in Edward the
Confessor&rsquo;s reign, will more clearly show the nature and extent
of the afforestation than any of the Chroniclers. From it
we find that about two-thirds of the district, including some
thirty manors, was entirely afforested. But it by no means
carries out the account that the villages were destroyed and
the inhabitants banished, or, according to others, murdered.
In some cases, as on Eling manor, it is noted that the houses
are still standing and the inmates living in the King&rsquo;s Forest.
Further, we find that some of the manors, as at Hordle and
Bashley, though considerably lessened, kept up their value.
Others, as at Efford, actually doubled their former assessments.
Still more remarkable, some again, as at Brockenhurst, Sway,
and Eling, though reduced in size, increased one-third and
two-thirds in value. One explanation can alone be given to
such facts&mdash;that only the waste lands were enclosed, and the
cultivated spared.</p>
<p>That this was the case we know for certain, for it is
expressly stated that, in some instances, as at Walhampton,
Lymington, and Rockford; only the woods are afforested, that
in many more the pastures are exempted, as at Wootton,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Batramsley, Oxley, Ossumley, Pilley, Boldreford, Vicar&rsquo;s Hill,
Yaldhurst, Boldre, and numerous other places.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> The manor of
Totton, though close to the Forest, was not touched, although
all the neighbouring estates were in various degrees afforested,
simply because it consisted of only pasture and plough-land,
whose value had increased no less than one-fourth. Nothing,
therefore, can be more conclusive than that the Conqueror did
not mercilessly make a total wilderness of the district, but,
not without some consideration, chose and took only those parts
which were suitable for the purposes of the chase.</p>
<p>In the woods which were afforested people were allowed to
live;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> though, probably, they voluntarily left them, as labour
could not there be so well obtained as in the unafforested parts.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
In all other respects there seems to have been no disarrangement.
Both on the outskirts and in the heart of the Forest,
the villains and borderers still worked as before, carrying on
their former occupations.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> The mills at Bashley, and Milford,
and Burgate, all in the Forest, went on the same. The fisheries
at Holdenhurst and Dibden were undisturbed. The salterns at
Eling and Hordle still continued at work, showing that the
people still, as before, sowed and reaped their corn, and pastured
and killed their cattle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Again, in other ways, <i>Domesday</i> still more clearly contradicts
the Chroniclers, as to the inhabitants being driven out
of their homes. Canterton was held by Chenna of Edward,
and still in <i>Domesday</i>, in part, remains in his possession.
Ulviet, the huntsman, who had rented Ripley manor under
Edward, still rents the unafforested portion. His son, Cola,
also a huntsman, holds, as his sub-tenant, land at Langley,
which he had rented of Edward; whilst his other son, Alwin,
holds land at Marchwood, which, also, he had rented. Saulf,
a West-Saxon thane, who had held land at Durley of Edward,
now holds it at Batramsley, and his wife at Hubborn, which
he had also rented of Edward.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Ulgar, a West-Saxon, holds the fourth of a hyde at Milford,
just as he had held it of Edward; with this difference, that it
was now assessed at three-fourths of a rood, on account of the
loss sustained by the woods being taken into the Forest. The
sons of Godric Malf, another West-Saxon thane, hold the same
lands which their father had held of Edward, at Ashley
and Crow, as also the manors of Bisterne and Minstead, these
last being rated considerably less than their real values, on
account of the afforestations, and what we should now call
severance. The West-Saxon Aluric rents property at Oxley,
Efford, and Brockenhurst, which his father and uncle rented
under Edward, and not only receives lands at Milford in
exchange for some taken into the Forest, but actually buys
estates at Whitefields from other West-Saxons.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Such facts must be stronger than any mere history compiled
by writers who were not only not near the spot, but the majority
of whom lived a long time after the events they venture so
minutely to describe.</p>
<p>But we have not yet exhausted the valuable evidence of
<i>Domesday</i>. The land in the Forest district is rented at much
less than in other parts of Hampshire, showing that it was
therefore poorer, and not only the land, but the mills. Further&mdash;and
this is of great importance, as so thoroughly overthrowing
the common account&mdash;we find in that portion of the survey
which comes under the title, &ldquo;In Nov&acirc; Forest&acirc; et circa eam,&rdquo;
only two churches mentioned, one at Milford, and another at
Brockenhurst, in the very heart of the Forest. Both stand
to this hour, and prove plainly by their Norman work that
William allowed them to remain.</p>
<p>Such is the evidence which <i>The Chronicle</i> and the short
examination of <i>Domesday</i> yield. The country itself, however,
still more plainly proves the bias of the Chroniclers.
The slightest acquaintance with geology will show that the
Forest was never fertile, as it must have been to have maintained
the population which filled so many churches.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> Nearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the whole of it is covered with sand, or capped with a thick
bed of drift, with a surface-soil only a few inches deep, capable
of naturally bearing little, except in a few places, besides heath
and furze. On a geological map we can pretty accurately trace
the limits of the Forest by the formation. Of course, in so
large a space, there will be some spots, and some valleys, where
the streams have left a richer glebe and a deeper tilth.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>But the Chroniclers, by their very exaggeration, have defeated
their own purpose. There is in their narration an
inconsistency, which, as we dwell upon it, becomes more apparent.
We would simply ask, where are the ruins of any of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the thirty or fifty churches, and the towns of the people who
filled them? Why, too, did not the Chroniclers mention them
specifically? Why, further, if William pulled down all the
churches, are the only two, at Brockenhurst and Milford, recorded
in <i>Domesday</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> still standing with their contemporary
workmanship? Why, too, is Fawley church, with its Norman
doorway, and pillars, and arches, formerly, as we know from
another portion of <i>Domesday</i>, in the Forest, remaining, if all
were destroyed? And why, last of all, if the inhabitants
were exterminated, was a church built at Boldre, in the very
wildest part of the Forest, immediately after the afforestation,
and another at Hordle?<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Had there been any buildings destroyed, all ruins of them
would not have been quite effaced, even in the course of eight
centuries. The country has been undisturbed. Nature has not
here, as in so many places, helped man in his work of destruction.
They cannot, we know, have been built on, or ploughed
over, or silted with sand, or choked with mud, or washed away by
water. The slightest artificial bank, though ever so old, can be
here instantly detected. The Keltic and West-Saxon barrows
still remain. The sites of the dwellings of the Britons are still
plainly visible. The Roman potteries are untouched, and their
vessels and cups, though lying but a few inches under the
ground, unbroken. We can only very fairly conclude that,
had there been houses, or villages, or churches destroyed, all
traces of them would not be gone, nor entirely lost in the
preserving record of local names.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>It has, I am aware, been urged that since the Old-English
churches were chiefly built of wood, we are not likely to find
any ruins. This may be so. But by no process of reasoning
can the absence of a thing prove its former presence. Nor
need we pay any attention to the argument drawn from such
names as Castle Malwood, The Castle near Burley, Castle Hill
on the banks of the Avon, Lucas Castle, and Broomy and
Thompson Castles in Ashley Walk. These Castles are of the
air&mdash;mere names, invented, as in other parts of England, by
the popular mind. At Castle Malwood there is the simple
trench of a camp, and recent excavations there showed no traces
of buildings; whilst the Castle at Burley, and Castle Hill, and
the others, were merely earthen fortifications and entrenchments,
made by the Kelts and West-Saxons. Nor must we
be led away by the few Forest names ending in <i>ton</i>, the Old-English
<i>t&uacute;n</i>, which, after all, means more often only a few
scattered homesteads than even a village, still less a town or
city, in the modern sense of the word.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>If, however, we look at the district from another point of
view, we shall find further evidence against the Chroniclers. It
was a part of the Natan Leaga<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>&mdash;a name still preserved in the
various Netleys, Nateleys, and Nutleys, which remain&mdash;the
Ytene of the British, that is, the furzy district, a title eminently
characteristic of the soil.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> Again, too, the villages and manors,
such as Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Ashurst, and half a dozen
more hursts, point to the woody nature of the place. Such
names, also, as Roydon, the rough ground; Bramshaw, the
bramble wood; Denny, the furzy ground; Wootton, the Odetune
of <i>Domesday</i>; Stockeyford and Stockleigh, the woody
place; Ashley, the ash ground;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> besides Staneswood, Arnwood,
and Testwood, all more or less afforested in <i>Domesday</i>, clearly
show its character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>After all, the best evidence is not from such arguments,
but in the simple fact that the New Forest remains still
the New Forest. Had the land been in any way profitable,
modern skill, and capital, and enterprise, would have
certainly been attracted. But its charms lie not, and never
did, in the richness of its soil, but in its deep woods and
wild moors.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>Our view of the matter, then, is that William, like all
Normans, loving the chase&mdash;loving, too, the red deer, as
the Old-English Chronicler, with a sneer, remarks, as if he
was their own father&mdash;converted what was before a half-wooded
tract, a great part of which he held in demesne,
inherited by right of being king, into a Royal Forest, giving
it the name of the New Forest, in contradistinction to its
former title of Ytene. To have laid waste a highly-cultivated
district for the purposes of the chase, as the Chroniclers wish
us to believe, would have defeated his chief object, as there
would have been no shelter then, nor for many years to come,
for the deer: and is contradicted, as we have seen, both by
<i>Domesday</i>, by the very nature of the soil, and the names
of the places.</p>
<p>The real truth is, that the stories, which fill our histories,
of William devastating the country, burning the houses, murdering
the people, have arisen from a totally wrong conception
of an ancient forest. Until this confusion of an old forest with
our modern ideas is removed, we can have no clear notions
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
on the subject. We must remember that an ancient forest did
not simply mean a space thickly covered with trees, but also
wild open ground, with lawns and glades. Its derivation points
out to what sort of places it was originally applied.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> The word
<i>hurst</i>, too, which, as we have seen, is so common a termination
throughout the district, means a wood which produces fodder for
cattle, answering to the Old High-German <i>spreidach</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> The old
forests possessed, if not a large, some scattered population. For
them a special code of laws was made, or rather gradually developed
itself. Canute himself appointed various officers&mdash;Primarii,
our Verderers; Lespegend, our Regarders; and Tinemen, our
Keepers. The offences of hunting, wounding, or killing a deer,
striking a verderer or regarder, cutting vert, are all minutely
specified in his Forest Law, and punished, according to rank and
other circumstances, with different degrees of severity.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> The
Court of Swanimote was, in a sense, counterpart to the Courts
of Folkemote and Portemote in towns. A forest was, in fact,
a kingdom within a kingdom, with certain, well-defined laws,
suited to its requirements, and differing from the common
law of the land. The inhabitants had regular occupations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
enjoyed, too, rights of pasturing cattle, feeding swine, and cutting
timber.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> All this, as we have seen, went on as before,
not so much, but still the same, in the New Forest. Manors,
too, with the exception of being subject to Forest Law, remained
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
in the heart of it unmolested. According to the Chroniclers
themselves, some rustics living on the spot convey, with a horse
and cart, the bleeding body of Rufus to Winchester. According
to them<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> also the King, previous to his death, must have feasted,
with his retinue of servants, and huntsmen, and priests, and
guests, somewhere in the Forest, implying means in the neighbourhood
to furnish, if not the luxuries, the necessities of life.
In <i>Domesday</i> we find, too, a keeper of the king&rsquo;s house holding
the mill at Efford; also implying, at least, in a very different
part of the Forest, a neighbourhood which could not have been
quite destitute and deserted.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> At a later period, when the
Forest Laws had reached their climax of oppression, persons
in the Forest, as we learn from Blount and the Testa de Nevill,
hold their lands at Lyndhurst and Eyeworth,<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> by finding provisions
for the king and fodder for his horse. But more than
all, <i>Domesday</i>, corroborated as it is by the physical characteristics
of the country, by the evidence, too, of local names, by
the Norman doorways, and pillars and arches at Fawley, and
Brockenhurst and Milford, proves most distinctly&mdash;and most
distinctly because so circumstantially&mdash;that the district was
neither devastated, nor the houses burnt, nor the churches
destroyed, nor the people murdered.</p>
<p>Some wrong, though, was doubtless committed: some hardships
undergone. Lands, however useless, cannot be afforested
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
without the feelings of the neighbourhood being outraged.
And the story, gathering strength in proportion as the Conqueror
and his son William the Red were hated by the conquered,
at last assumed the tragical form which the Chroniclers have
handed down to us, and modern historians repeated.</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s cruelty, however, lay not certainly in afforesting
the district: it consisted rather in the systematic way in which
he strove to reduce the English into abject slavery; in the
fresh tortures with which he loaded the Danish Forest Laws;
and in making it far better to kill a man than a deer. For
these exactions was it that his family paid the penalty of their
lives; and the retribution befel them there, where the superstitious
West-Saxon would, above all others, have marked out
as the spot fitted for their deaths.</p>

<p>We need not dwell so long upon this as the former portion
of the History, for in many cases it is nothing but a bare recital
of perambulations and Acts of Parliament. The true history of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
a forest is rather an account of its trees and its flowers and
birds, than an historical narrative. Yet even here there are
some important facts connected with the nation&rsquo;s life, and illustrating
the character of its kings.</p>
<p>We meet with no perambulation of the New Forest until
the eighth year of Edward I.&mdash;the second ever made of an
English forest&mdash;and, by comparing it with <i>Domesday</i>, we may
see how, since the Conqueror&rsquo;s time, the Forest had gradually
taken the natural limits of the country&mdash;the Avon and the
Southampton Water bounding it on the east and west, and the
sea on the south, and the chalk of Wiltshire on the north.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>The next perambulation in the twenty-ninth year of the
same reign is more noticeable,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> as it disafforests so much. It is
the same perambulation which we find made in the twenty-second
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
year of Charles II., and nominally the same which is followed
to this day.</p>
<p>To understand the cause of the difference in these perambulations,
we must, in fact, thoroughly understand the great movements
which had been going on during the previous years, and
the increasing power of the nobles and the people. From
Henry III. had been wrung the Charta de Forest&acirc;, the terms
of which had been settled before John&rsquo;s death. Still, little, or
scarcely anything, was put into practical effect. In 1297,
however, the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk not only refused to
accompany Edward I. to Flanders, but, upon their suspension
from their offices, issued a proclamation, complaining that the
two Charters of the liberties of the people were not observed.
On the 10th of October, a Parliament was assembled, and his
son passed the &ldquo;Confirmatio Cartarum,&rdquo; to which Edward, now
at Ghent, assented. Still the two earls, from various causes,
were not satisfied; and in 1298 demanded that the perambulations
of the different Forests should be made. In consequence,
during the summer of the next year, the King issued writs
to the sheriffs, promising that the commissioners should meet
about Michaelmas at Northampton.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>This was done: and the perambulation of the New Forest
was carried out in strict accordance with the provisions of the
Charta de Forest&acirc;, for the jurors who were employed expressly
state that the bounds which they have determined were those
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of the Forest before the reign of Henry II.; and that all those
places mentioned in the perambulation of 1279 and now omitted,
were afforested by his successors, though they cannot say to
what extent or by whom.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> Most probably it had been reserved
for John to show here, as in other cases, to what absolute
madness selfishness will carry a man.</p>
<p>After this, nothing, with one exception, of any general
importance occurs.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> Having in his prosperity incurred all
the odium of attempting to revive the hated Forest Laws, in
his adversity Charles I. granted as security the New Forest, and
Sherwood, and other Crown lands to his creditors.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> He had
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
still learnt no lesson from the Ship-money, and would have
pawned England itself, rather than yield to that obstinacy, which
was but the other side of his weakness of character.</p>
<p>With the decline of hawking and hunting, the Forest Laws
fell into decay, and the Forests themselves were less regarded,
and their boundaries less strictly observed. Under the Stuarts,
we find the first traces of that system, which at last resulted
in the almost entire devastation of the New Forest. James I.
granted no less than twenty assart lands&mdash;<i>agri ex-sariti</i>&mdash;there
having been previously only three;<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> and gave the privilege of
windfalls to various persons;<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> whilst officers actually applied to
him for trees in lieu of pay for their troops:<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> and Charles II.
bestowed the young woods of Brockenhurst to the maids of
honour of his court.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Manwood, who wrote towards the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,
had, long before this, predicted what must happen, and the
straits to which the English navy, as we know was the case,
would be reduced. In Charles I.&rsquo;s time the Forests were in a
shameful condition. The keepers were in arrears of wages, and
paid themselves out of the timber.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> The consequences soon
came. There was nothing left but wind-shaken and decayed
trees in the New Forest, quite unfit for building ships.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a>
Charles II., however, in 1669, probably influenced by Evelyn&rsquo;s
<i>Silva</i>, which appeared four years before, and had given a great
impulse, throughout England, to planting, enclosed three
hundred acres as a nursery for young oaks. But the waste and
devastation still continued. At last, William III. legislated
on the subject, for, to use the words of the Act, &ldquo;the Forest
was in danger of being destroyed;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> and power was given to
plant six thousand acres. In 1703 came the great hurricane,
which Evelyn so deplores, uprooting some four thousand of the
best oaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Nothing was done towards planting during the reigns of
Anne and George I.;<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> and Phillipson&rsquo;s and Pitt&rsquo;s plantations
in 1755 and 1756 are the next, but they have never thrived, owing
to the land not having been drained, and the trees not having
been thinned out at the proper time.</p>
<p>In 1789 a Commission was appointed, and revealed a terrible
state of things. William&rsquo;s provisions had not only been set
aside, but defied. Cattle were turned out, the furze and heath
cut, and the marl dug by those who had no privileges. The
Forest was, in fact, robbed under every pretext. The deer, from
being overstocked, died in the winter by hundreds from starvation.
On every side, too, encroachments were made by those
whose business it was to prevent them. The rabbits destroyed
the young timber, whilst the old was stolen.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></p>
<p>In 1800 there was fresh legislation,<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> but it does not seem to
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
have taken much effect; though, in 1808, a new system of planting
upon a definite plan was introduced.</p>
<p>In 1848 another Commission was appointed, and showed that
the old abuses still lingered, that depredations were still committed,
and encroachments still made.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> Law was at last
restored. A great number of the claims were disallowed, and
the rights of the commoners defined. So many head of cattle
may now be turned out, by those who have Forest rights,
through the year, except during the fence-month, which lasts
from the 20th of June to the 20th of July, and the winter-hayning,
from the 22nd of November to the 4th of May. Pigs,
too, upon a nominal payment, may also be turned out for the
mast and acorns during the pannage-month, lasting from
September the 25th to the 22nd of November, by those who
have a right to common of pannage; whilst any person can, by
applying to the woodmen, buy wood for fuel.</p>
<p>Lastly, in 1851, the deer, the cause of so much ill-feeling
and crime, were abolished, and the Crown thereby acquired the
right of planting 10,000 additional acres.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> These changes have
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
already effected much good both for the district and the inhabitants.
The enclosures are now systematically drained; and the
Foresters find, in the works which are being carried forward,
regular employment throughout the year.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> A large nursery has
been formed at Rhinefield, and somewhere about 700 acres
are annually planted, the young oaks being set between Scotch
firs, which serve both as &ldquo;nurses&rdquo; to draw them up, and a
screen to shelter them from the winds. Experiments, too, are
being made to acclimatize several new trees, but it is premature
to judge with what success.</p>
<p>Further, I need scarcely add that all sorts of schemes,
from the day when Defoe proposed to colonize the district
with the Palatine refugees from the Rhine to the present, have
been suggested for reclaiming the Forest. None have ever,
from the nature of the soil, been found to answer; and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
present condition is certainly, for many reasons, the best.
The time will some day arrive when, as England becomes
more and more overcrowded,&mdash;as each heath and
common are swallowed up,&mdash;the New Forest will be as much
a necessity to the country as the parks are now to London.
We talk about the duty of reclaiming waste lands, and making
corn spring up where none before grew. But it is often
as much a duty to leave them alone. Land has higher and
nobler offices to perform than to support houses or grow corn&mdash;to
nourish not so much the body as the mind of man, to gladden
the eye with its loveliness, and to brace his soul with that
strength which is alone to be gained in the solitude of the moors
and the woods.</p>

</div>
<p>This corner of the Forest, once perhaps the most beautiful,
is now the least known, because, to most people, so inaccessible.
It lies quite by itself. No railway yet disfigures its fields and
dells. The best way to see it and the whole Forest is to cross
the ferry at Southampton, and land at the hard at Hythe. And
as we cross, behind us, amongst a clump of trees, rises the ruined
west end of Netley Abbey Church, and the modern tower on
Henry VIII.&rsquo;s Fort; whilst, lower down, the new Government
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Hospital loads the shore with all its costly ugliness. If we
have not, perhaps, yet reached the height of Continental profanity
which has turned the Convent of Cordova into barracks,
and St. Bernard&rsquo;s Monastery at Clairvaux into a prison, and
the Church of Cluny into racing stables, we yet seem to delight
to place side by side with the noblest conceptions that ever
rose in beauty from English ground, our modern abortions.
There is not a cathedral town whose minster-square is not disgraced
by some pretentious shed. And now Government not
only invades the country, but chooses above all, the better
to display our folly, that place which the old Cistercian
monks had for ever made sacred by the loveliness of faith
and work.</p>
<p>Hythe is only a little village, but as its name shows, once
the port of the New Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> The Forest, however, has now
receded from it, and in this chapter we shall see nothing of
its woods. The district, however, is too important in a historical
point of view to be omitted. The walk, even though
it is not over wild moors and commons, is still very beautiful.
True English lanes will lead us by quiet dells, with glimpses
here and there through hedgerow elms of the blue Southampton
water, down to the shore of the Solent.</p>
<p>So, leaving Hythe<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> and going southward, skirting Cadlands
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Park, we reach Fawley, the Falalie and Falegia of <i>Domesday</i>,
where Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, held in demesne, as
Abbey land, one hyde and three yardlands. The whole of
the manor was thrown into the Forest, but in its place now
are ploughed fields and grass pastures. The church, with its
central tower, stands at the entrance of the village, and its
handsome Romanesque doorway shows plainly that the Conqueror
did not destroy every place of worship. The building
was partially restored in 1844, but the pillars on the north
side of the chancel were copied from the original Norman
work, which, with the three piscinas and the hagioscope, give
it a further interest to the ecclesiologist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>After Fawley, the walk becomes more beautiful. We pass
deep lanes and scattered cottages set in their trim gardens,
when suddenly on the shore rises the round gray castle of
Calshot, standing at the very end of a bar of sand, separating
the Southampton water from the Solent. Though much
repaired, it stands not much altered from Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
original blockhouse. Once of great importance, its garrison
now consists of only the coastguard and a master-gunner.
Its walls are still strong, measuring in the lower embrasures
sixteen feet through, but the upper storeys are much
slighter. On the west side is cut the date 1513, whilst some
stone cannon balls of the Commonwealth period show the importance
Cromwell attached to the place. But the stronger
fortifications of Hurst, and the new batteries in the Isle of
Wight, have done away with its necessity, and it stands now
only as a monument of Tudor patriotism and of Cromwell&rsquo;s
care.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>But the place has older associations than these. In <i>The
Chronicle</i> and <i>Florence of Worcester</i> we read<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> that, in 495, Cerdic
and his son Cynric arrived with five ships, and landed at Cerdices-ora,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
and on the same day defeated the natives. No site has given
rise to so much discussion as this Cerdices-ora. Mr. Thorpe
in one place says it is not known, whilst in another, by an
evident oversight, he fixes upon Charford.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> Dr. Guest places
it at the mouth of the river Itchen,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> whilst Mr. Pearson and
others have identified it with Yarmouth.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> Now, I think there
can be little doubt, looking both at the etymology of the name
and the situation, that Calshot is the true place. The land
here runs out into the sea with no less than ten fathoms of
water close to it, so that large vessels can to this day lie alongside
the Castle. It is the first part, too, of the mainland which
can be reached, and on its north side offers a safe anchorage.
Besides, about four miles off stand some barrows, which, though
we may not be able to identify them as covering those slain in
the first battle which the West-Saxons fought, offer some
presumption in favour of that theory. In the very word
Calshot, and its intermediate forms of Caushot, Caldshore, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Cauldshore,<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> we may, without difficulty, recognize a corruption
of the original Cerdices-ora of the <i>Chronicle</i> and <i>Florence</i>.
The word is formed like the names of various places close by,
such as Needsore (the under-shore) and Stansore Point.<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> But
going farther back, we come much nearer to its original form
in the old Forest perambulation made in the eighth year of
Edward I., where it is spelt Kalkesore.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> As then, Charford,
on the north-east borders of the New Forest, is the representative
of Cerdices-ford, where Cerdic&rsquo;s last victory was gained
over Ambrosius; so here, I think, at the south-west, near Kalkesore,
now Calshot, was his first achieved.</p>
<p>From this point the scenery completely changes. Instead of
lanes and cultivated fields, the shingly beach of the Solent,
covered in places to the water&rsquo;s edge with woods, sweeps away to
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
the west. Passing on to Eagle-hurst, and noticing the truth
of the termination even to this day, let us sit down on the
shore. Here is a view which should be remembered. In one
sense the world cannot show its equal. Far away to the
east stretches the low Hampshire coast, ended by the harbour
of Portsmouth and its bare forest of masts. To the south,
towards Spithead, rides the long line of battle-ships; and
round the harbours of the two Cowes sail fleets of yachts,
showing how much still of the old Scandinavian blood runs in
our veins&mdash;of the spirit which finds employment in adventure
and delight in danger. Steamers, with their black pennants
of smoke, hurry down the narrow strait, carrying the news
or the merchandise of the world; whilst all is overshadowed
by supreme natural beauty, the hills of the Isle of Wight
standing boldly up, crested with their soft green downs, and
their dark purple shadows resting fold over fold on the valley
sides. Still continuing along the shore we reach Leap, a small
fishing village, where boats ply across from its hard to the Island.
Its name is, perhaps, derived from the Old-English <i>leap</i>, a weel,
or basket for catching fish.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> Here, it is said, but I know not on
what authority save that worst&mdash;tradition, that the Dauphin,
afterwards Louis VIII. of France, embarked after the defeat of
his army at Lincoln, and his fleet off Dover. Certain it is that
he had adherents to his cause in the neighbourhood, especially
in William de Vernon, whose arms were formerly blazoned with
his own in the east window of the north aisle of the Forest
Church of Boldre.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>On somewhat better authority,<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> it rests that the unhappy
Charles I., on the 13th of November, 1647, outwitted by his
enemies and deceived by his friends, entrusted himself, after his
flight from Hampton Court, to Colonel Hammond, and, embarking
here, returned by Hurst to atone for the past by his life.</p>
<p>But of greater interest is the Roman Road which connected
Leap with Southampton and Winchester in one direction, and
Ringwood and the west in another. Its traces may be found
not only here but on the opposite side, where, still known by the
Norman name of Rue Street, it passes westward of Carisbrook to
the extreme south of the Island.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> Its old appellation is preserved,
too, on this side in the name of a farmhouse&mdash;King&rsquo;s
Rue, and Rue Copse, and Rue Common; and it is well worthy
of notice that this word is even now sometimes used in the
Forest, as in Sussex, for a row or hedgerow. Previous to it,
however, there existed a British track, still clearly visible across
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the Forest, especially near Butts Ash barrows, by its deep
depressions. Both roads, though, can still tell us something
of the past. The opinion of late philologists and geographers,
with the exception of Lappenburg and Sir G. C. Lewis, has
been against the idea that the Isle of Wight was the Vectis
or Ictis of the ancients. The argument, however, against
the passage in Diodorus Siculus,<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a> that it would be so much
easier for the first traders to have exported the tin from
Belerium instead of bringing it by inland transport to the
Island, and then shipping it to Gaul, is founded upon
ignorance. Sea carriage was then far more difficult and
dangerous than land conveyance. Ancient mariners were easily
frightened, and their vessels put into land every night. As Sir
G. C. Lewis further remarks, foreign merchants were always regarded
with jealousy and distrust, and the overland route would
enable the traffic to be carried out through the whole distance by
native traders.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>Singularly enough, however, Warner<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> states that a large
mass of tin was found on the very site of this old Roman road,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
or, rather, as the fact of the mere shapeless mass would prove,
on the older British track. Not only, too, was tin brought here
from Cornwall, but also, in later times, lead from the Mendip
Hills. Pigs of it have been picked up on a branch of the same
Roman road running from Uphill on the Severn to Salisbury,
and from thence joining the Leap road. One of them, stamped
with the name of Hadrian, is now in the Bath Museum. We
are thus enabled to connect Leap with the famous passage of
the Greek historian.</p>
<p>Sir George Lewis&rsquo;s theory has, too, been singularly corroborated
in other directions, especially by the large quantities of
bronze ornaments found during the excavations in the Swiss
Lakes, 1853 and 1854, the metals of which could only have
been brought there by an overland route.</p>
<p>Further, too, we must not reject the account of Diodorus,
because he says that at low tide the tin was carried over in
carts. We must remember the extremely indefinite views of
the ancients on all geographical subjects. The vaguest ideas
were held, especially about Britain. Erring in a different
direction, the mistake is not so bad as Pliny&rsquo;s, in making the
Island six days&rsquo; sail from England. There seems, however, a
most natural explanation, that Diodorus, not having been there,
took for granted the wild traditions and rumours which reached
him, and which, even in these days, with only the slightest
possible variation of form, still hold their ground with the
Forest peasantry, in the legend that the stone of which Beaulieu
Abbey is built was brought over the dry bed of the Solent,
in carts, from the Binstead Quarries.</p>
<p>Still the passage is not without the further difficulty, that
Diodorus seems, from the context, to have supposed that the
Island was situated close to where the tin was dug. This, again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
must be set down to that ignorance of geography, which has
involved all Greek writers in such extraordinary mistakes.</p>
<p>Leap itself is now nothing but a village, with a scattered
agricultural population; some few, however, maintaining themselves
by fishing in the summer, and in the winter by shooting
the ducks and geese which flock to the creeks and harbours of
the Solent. Leaving it, and still keeping westward, we come
to the Beaulieu river, where, in the autumn, after the heavy
floods from the Forest, the salmon leap and sport in the
freshets. The road now winds past Exbury by the side of
thick copses which fringe the river. At last, at Hill Top, we
reach Beaulieu Heath, and, in the far distance, the green foliage
of the Forest hangs cloudlike in the air, whilst down in the
valley lies the village of Beaulieu.</p>

<p>I should trust that, on a fine day, twenty miles are not too
much for any Englishman. If they are, and any one should
think the walk along the coast too long, Beaulieu may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
reached by going direct from Hythe, across Beaulieu Common.
The moor stretches out on all sides, flushed in the summer
with purple heather, northward to the Forest, southward to
the cultivated fields round Leap and Exbury. Passing &ldquo;The
Nodes,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> the road runs quite straight to Hill Top, with its
clump of firs, which we reached in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Down in the valley, hid from us by a turn in the road, lies
Beaulieu. But a little farther on we reach part of the old
Abbey walls, broken here and there, clustered with ivy, and
grass, and yellow mullein, and white yarrow, whilst vine-clad
cottages stand against its sides. The village is situated on a
bend of the Exe, where, spanned by a bridge, the stream falls
over the weir, formerly turning the old mill-wheel of the monks,
and then, broadening with the tide, winds through meadows
and thick oak copses down to the Solent.</p>
<p>Although far more beautifully situated, the Abbey is not
nearly so well known as its own filial house at Netley, simply
because more out of the way. For a moment let us give some
account of its foundation, illustrating as it does both King
John&rsquo;s cruelty and superstition. The story, as told by the
monks, is that John, after various oppressions of the Cistercian
Order, in the year 1204, convened their abbots to his Parliament
at Lincoln. As soon as they came, he ordered his
retainers to charge them on horseback. No one was found to
obey such a command. The monks fled to their lodgings.
That night the King dreamt he was led before a judge, who
ordered him to be scourged by these very monks. The next
morning John narrated his dream, which was so vivid that he
declared he felt the blows when he awoke, to a priest of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
court, who told him that God had been most merciful in thus
simply chastising him in this world, and revealing the secrets
of His will. He advised him at once to send for the abbots,
whom he had so ill-treated, and to implore their pardon.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></p>
<p>Some truth, doubtless, underlies this story. Certain it is
that in the same year, or the next, John founded the Abbey at
Beaulieu, then Bellus Locus, so called from its beauty, placing
there thirty monks from St. Mary&rsquo;s, at Citeaux, endowing it
with land in the New Forest, and manors, and villages, and
churches in Berkshire; exempting it from various services and
taxes and tolls; giving further, out of his own treasury, a
hundred marks; and ordering all other Cistercian Houses to
assist in the work. Not only did he do this, but he revoked
his gift of the manor of Farendon, which, in the previous year,
he had conditionally bestowed on some other Cistercian monks,
and now transferred it to Beaulieu, making the House at Faringdon
a mere offshoot from the larger building.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> And the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
abbot designate repaid him in his life-time by accusing his
enemy, Stephen of Canterbury, before the Pope, for treason,
and causing him to be suspended.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
<p>John died, and Henry III. not only confirmed the privileges,
but granted several more in consideration of the great expense
of the building, and Innocent III. gave it the right of a sanctuary.
So the work proceeded. The stone was quarried principally
from the opposite limestone-beds in the Isle of Wight;
and was brought over, says tradition, curiously illustrating
the vague notions of ancient geography, which we have seen in
Diodorus Siculus,<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> in carts. Not, however, till 1249, some
forty-five years after its foundation, was the monastery finished.
Henry himself, and his Queen, and Richard, Earl of Cornwall,
and a long train of nobles and prelates, came to its dedication
on the feast of St. John; Hugh, the first abbot, spending no
less than five hundred marks on the entertainment.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>So, at last, the good work was accomplished, and men came
here and lived, taking for their pattern the holy St. Benedict,
and finding the problem of life solved by daily prayer to heaven
and labour on earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Here, to its sanctuary, in 1471, after she had landed at
Southampton on Easter Day, the very day of the battle of
Barnet, fled the Countess of Warwick, wife of the King-maker,
slain on that bloody field.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> Here, too, in 1497, after having
raised the siege of Exeter, and deserted his troops at Taunton,
fled the worthless Perkin Warbeck, not only an impostor, but
a coward, closely pursued by Lord Daubeny and five hundred
men. Persuaded, however, by Henry VII.&rsquo;s promises, he left
his shelter only to become a prisoner in the Tower, and finally
to expiate his deceit at Tyburn.</p>
<p>So years passed at the Abbey, the monks happy in saying their
daily prayers, content to see the corn grow, and their vineyards
ripen, and their flocks increase, knowing little of the troubles
which raged in the outer world, save when some forlorn fugitive
arrived. But even what is best becomes the worst. Time
brought a change of spirit on all the monasteries. Long before
the middle of the sixteenth century the stern earnestness of a
former age had dwindled into effeminacy and sensuality. Piety
had sunk into gross idolatry; and faith, amongst the laity, had
been corrupted into credulity, and, with the priests, into
hypocrisy. The greatest blessings had festered into curses.
It was so, we know, through all England. And Beaulieu
must suffer with the rest of the monasteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>In 1537, the Abbey was dissolved, the last Abbot, Thomas
Stephens, with twenty out of the thirty monks, signing the deed
of surrender.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> Stephens was pensioned off with a hundred
marks; and some of the monks received various annuities and
compensations for their losses. So fell the monastery of
Beaulieu, and its stones went to build Henry VIII.&rsquo;s martello
tower at Hurst, and its lead to repair Calshot,<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> to fight against
the very Power which had raised it to its glory.</p>
<p>Few abbeys have known so lovely a site. Placed close to the
banks, it overlooked the Exe, formed by the tide more into a
lake than a river. On every side it was sheltered: on the north
by rising ground and the woods of the New Forest, and on
the east again by the Forest and more hills, from whence an
aqueduct brought down the water for the use of the monks;
and on the south and west all was guarded by the river.</p>
<p>To this day the outer walls are in places standing, with
the water-gate covered with ivy. And inside is the palace,
placed amongst its own grounds, surrounded by elms. Above
its doorway is cut a canopied niche, where stood the patron
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
saint, the Virgin, and above runs the string-course, supported
by its carved corbel-heads. But the whole building has been
unfortunately defaced by a moat and turretted wall, built as
a defence by one of the Montagues against French privateers,
as also by the modernized windows.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></p>
<p>The entrance-hall, too, like all the other rooms, has been
sadly modernized, though its fine groined roof, springing from
four shafts on each side, and a lancet window in the east
wall, still remain. Upstairs, also, is left some oak panelling
of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time, of the linen pattern, but covered over
with paint. Eastward, in the meadow adjoining, stands the
guest-house, better known in the village, from its former occupants,
as Burman&rsquo;s House. Passing through it, we suddenly
come upon the green quadrangle once surrounded with cloisters,
where the three arches leading into the chapter-house still
remain. The black Purbeck marble shafts, and bands, and
capitals, have, however, long since become weather-worn and
decayed, though the Binstead and Caen stone still stands, here
and there covered with ivy, crested with wall-flowers, and white
and crimson pinks, and rusted with lichens.</p>
<p>In the chapter-house are strewed the broken pillars which
supported the groined roof, and the broken stone-seats which
ran round the inside, whilst on the floor lie a stone coffin
and gravestones. To the north of it stand the ruins of the
sacristy.</p>
<p>Of the cloisters, the north alley is the most perfect, with
its seven carols, where the monks sat and talked; whilst above
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
project the corbels which carried the cloister-roof. Here and
there, too, as at the two north doors leading into the church,
some of the original pavement still remains.</p>
<p>The church, however, has long since been destroyed.
Nothing, except a portion of the south transept, is left. The
foundations, though, can be accurately traced, showing the nave
and aisles, and the large circular apse at the east end. Scattered
about, too, appear the tesselated floor, bright as on the day
it was laid down, and the graves of the abbots, and of Isabella,
first wife of Richard Earl of Cornwall.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
<p>Out in the fields beyond stand the ruins of a building, now
a mere pinfold for cattle, called by tradition the Monk&rsquo;s Vine-Press,
whilst the meadows beyond, lying on the slope of the
hill, are still known as &ldquo;the Vineyards.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<p>But the refectory still remains on the south side of the
cloisters, from which a doorway, still ornamented with iron
scroll-work, used to lead. Ever since the Reformation it has
served as the parish church, differing only in its appearance by
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
its lack of orientation.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> In 1746 it was repaired, and its original
roof lowered, and its fine triplet at the south end spoilt by
a buttress, and one of the lancets lighting the wall-passage on
the west side also blocked up. Its walls, however, are now
covered with common spleenwort, and wall-lettuce, and pellitory,
whilst the narrow-leaved rue&mdash;the &ldquo;herb o&rsquo; grace o&rsquo; Sundays&rdquo;&mdash;with
which the old churchyards used to be sown, shows its
pale blue blossoms amongst the gravestones.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill14">
<img id="fig14" src="images/image068.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">Pulpit of the Refectory.</p>
</div>
<p>Inside it is still more interesting.
Here still stands
the lovely stone pulpit, its
panels rich with flower-tracery,
approached by a wall-passage
and open arcade
springing from double rows
of black Purbeck marble pillars.
This was the old rostrum
of the monks, where one of
the brethren read to the rest
at their meals; so that, as
St. Augustine says, their
mouths should not only taste,
but their ears also drink in
the Word of God. Here, in
this very village church, the
old Cistercian monks obeyed
the injunction
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
of their order<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a>,&mdash;&ldquo;When
we enter, let us bare our heads, and going to our
seats bend before the cross. Let us not behave idly, lest we
give offence to any one. Let not our eyes wander, lest we give
occasion for bickering, or quarrelling, or laughing; but fulfilling
the saying of the blessed Hugh of Lincoln, &lsquo;let us keep
our eyes upon the table, our ears with the reader, and our
hearts with God.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></p>
<p>In the churchyard, plainly traceable by the ruined foundations,
and mounds, and depressions, are the sites of the lavatory
and kitchens, whilst in the fields beyond lie the fish-ponds.
Everywhere, in fact, are seen the traces of the monks. Their
walks still remain by the side of the Exe, overgrown with oaks,
bright in the spring with blue and crimson lungwort, and sweet
with violets, such as grew when Anne Beauchamp sought refuge
here that dismal Easter day.</p>
<p>Not only do the Abbey grounds,<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> but the whole district,
show the size of the monastery. Going out of Beaulieu, upon
the road to Bucklershard, we come upon the ox-farm of the
monks, still called Bouvery, and still famous for its grazing
land. A little farther, about the centre of their various farmsteads,
at St. Leonard&rsquo;s, better known now as the Abbey Walls,
stands part of the large barn, or <i>spicarium</i>, of the monastery,
such as still remains in other parts of England&mdash;at Cerne Abbey,
and Abbotsbury, and Sherborne, and Battle Abbey.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> A modern
barn now stands within it, partly formed by its walls, but its
original size is well shown by the lofty eastern gable, locally
called the Pinnacle, which, covered with ivy, overhangs the road.
Close to the old farm-house, built from its ruins, stands a small
roofless Decorated Chapel. The west window, and the arch of
the west doorway, still remain, and at the same end still project
the corbels which supported the gallery. In the east wall are
canopied niches, under which stood figures; and on the south
the piscina, and the broken conduit where the water ran, and
two aumbries are still visible, whilst opposite to them, in
the present doorway, another aumbrie is inserted with its two
grooves for shelves cut in the stone.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Close to St. Leonard&rsquo;s lies also the sheep-farm of the
monks, still called Bargery, and still famous for its sheep-land.
Nearer Bucklershard is Park Farm, another grange, where
fifty years ago stood a chapel, smaller even than the one we
have just seen, partly Early-English and Decorated. It was
divided into two compartments by a stone screen reaching to
a plain roof. The piscina in the south wall was finally used
by the ploughmen to mix their wheat with lime, until the whole
building was pulled down to enlarge the farm-house from whose
south-east end it projected.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a></p>
<p>At these two granges the brethren worked in summer from
chapter till tierce, and from nones till vespers. Here lived
the ploughmen and artisans, the millers, and smiths, and carpenters,
of the monastery. For them were these chapels built,
lest either the weather or the roads might prevent them going
to the Abbey Church.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a> Here they all worshipped as one family,
the serf no longer a serf, but a freedman, when he entered the
service of the abbey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Farther away to the westward lies Sowley Pond, called in
the Abbey Charters Colgrimesmore, and Frieswater, covering
some ninety acres, formerly the boundary of the abbey estate,
and used by the monks as a preserve for their fish. Here
once were iron-works, whose blast-furnaces were heated with
wood and charcoal from the Forest. The iron-stone was brought
from Hengistbury Head and the Hordle Cliffs, and after being
melted was shaped by the tilt-hammers, and finally sent off
inland to Reading, or shipped at Pitt&rsquo;s Deep. But like all the
other ferraria of Sussex and Hampshire, these too have long
since been stopped, driven out of the field by the Staffordshire
iron-works. Nothing now remains to tell their former
importance but a few mounds and the village Forge-Hammer
Inn, and a country proverb, &ldquo;There will be rain when Sowley
hammer is heard,&rdquo; whose meaning is fast being lost.</p>
<p>Returning, however, to Beaulieu, let us once more look at
the old abbey and the ruins of the cloisters, and try to imagine
for ourselves the time when, secluded from the world, in the
midst of the New Forest, the monks from Citeaux prayed and
worked, clad in their coarse white woollen robes, and slept,
according to their vow, on pallets of straw, giving shelter to
the fugitive, and food to the hungry.<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> It is only by seeing
some such grey ruins as these, still breathing of a long past
religion, placed amongst the solitude of their own green meadows
and woods, by the silent lapse of some stream flowing and ebbing
with every tide, that we can at all understand the meaning of a
life of contemplation, and its true value. Along these cloisters
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
paced the brethren, their eyes bent on the earth, their thoughts
on heaven. Here tolled the great abbey-bell, its sound, full
of solemn sweetness, borne not only over the lonely Forest, but
down the river seaward to the tossing sailor. Here was that
comfort, which could never fail, offered to the most desolate,
and heaven itself, as a fatherland, to the exile. Here the great
gate not only rolled back the noise of the world, but, to show
that mercy is ever better than vengeance, stayed the hand of
the law, and blunted the sword of the pursuer.</p>
<p>In these days we are surrounded by noise and excitement.
Everywhere is haste and its accompanying confusion. It matters
not what we do, the fever of competition ever rages. We travel
as though we were flying from ourselves. We write the history
of things before they are accomplished, and the lives of men
before they are dead. Surely there is some profit to be found
in coming to a quiet village like this, if it will only give us
some glimpses of a life which stands out in such strange contrast
to our own.</p>

<p class="pcap">View in Frame Wood, Brockenhurst.</p>
</div>
<p>At present we have seen nothing of the actual Forest. It is
only as we go northward that we begin to enter its woods.
Instead of the old Forest track, a road now runs from Beaulieu
to Brockenhurst, along which we will go. So, leaving the
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
village, and passing a few straggling half-timbered cottages,
we reach Stickland&rsquo;s Hill, where, down in the valley, we can
see the Exe winding round the old Abbot&rsquo;s House set amongst
its green elms. Farther on we come to Hatchet Gate, and the
Forest then spreads before us, with Hatchet Pond on our left,
and Little Wood and the Moon Hill Woods on our right;
whilst, here and there on the common, rise scattered barrows.</p>
<p>And now, instead of keeping to the road, let the reader make
right across the plain, by one of the Forest tracks, to the woods
at Iron&rsquo;s Hill. The stories, with which most books on the
Forest abound, of persons being swamped in morasses, are much
exaggerated. Mind only this simple rule&mdash;wherever you see the
white cotton-grass growing, and the bog-moss particularly fine
and green, to avoid that place.</p>
<p>And now, when you are fairly out on the moor, you will feel
the fresh salt breeze blowing up from the Solent, and see the
long treeless line of the Island hills in strange contrast with
the masses of wood in front; whilst the moor itself, if it be
August, waves with purple and crimson, except where, here and
there, rise great beds of fern-green islands, in the red sea
of heath.</p>
<p>Most of the finest timber at Iron&rsquo;s Hill and Palmer&rsquo;s
Water has been lately cut. Keeping on, however, we shall
again come out upon the road which leads down to the stream,
close to a mill. Passing over the footbridge, we skirt Brockenhurst
Manor, where, at Watcombe, once lived Howard the philanthropist,
and so at last reach the village.</p>
<p>So greatly has the Forest been reduced in size, that Brockenhurst,
once nearly its centre, is now only a border village. Its
Old-English name (the badger&rsquo;s wood), like that of Everton,
the wild-boar place, on the southern side of the Forest, tells
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
its own story. It consists of one long straggling street, and a
few scattered houses, with one or two village inns. Much of
its wildness has been spoilt by the railroad; and in consequence,
too, of the adjoining manor of Brockenhurst, it appears even
less than it really is in the Forest. Still, however, if the reader
wishes to see the Forest woods and heaths towards the south,
let him come here, and the village accommodation will only give
an additional charm to the scenery. I, for my part, do not
know that a clean English village inn, with its sanded floor,
and its best parlour kept for state occasions, makes such bad
quarters. It is a real pleasure to find some spots on the earth
not yet disfigured by fashionable hotels.</p>
<p>At Brockenhurst existed one of those tenures of knight-service
once so common throughout England. Here Peter Spelman, an
ancestor of the antiquary, held a carucate of land by the service
of finding for Edward II. an esquire clad in coat of mail for
forty days in the year, and whenever the King came to the
village to hunt, litter for his bed, and hay for his horse, which
last clause will give us some insight into the often rough living
and habits of the fourteenth century.<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> Here, too, not many
years ago, droves of deer would at night, when all was still,
race up the village street, and the village dogs leap out and kill
them, or chase them back to the Forest.</p>
<p>The church, one of the only two in the Forest mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
in <i>Domesday</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a> is built on an artificial mound on the top of a
hill, a little way out of the village, so that it might serve as
a landmark in the Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> The church has been sadly mutilated.
A wretched brick tower has been patched on at the west
end; and on the north side a new staring red brick aisle, which
surpasses even the usual standard of ugliness of a dissenting
chapel. On the south side stands the Norman doorway, with
plain escalloped capitals, and an outside arch ornamented with
the indented and chevron mouldings. The chancel is Early-English,
whilst the plain chancel arch which springs without
even an impost from the wall, is very early Norman. Under one
of the chancel windows rises the arch of an Easter sepulchre,
whilst a square Norman font, of black Purbeck marble, stands
at the south-west end of the nave.</p>
<p>If the church, however, has been disfigured, the approach to
it fortunately remains in all its beauty. For a piece of quiet
English scenery nothing can exceed this. A deep lane, its
banks a garden of ferns, its hedge matted with honeysuckle, and
woven together with bryony, runs, winding along a side space
of green, to the latch-gate, guarded by an enormous oak, its
limbs now fast decaying, its rough bark grey with the perpetual
snow of lichens, and here and there burnished with soft streaks
of russet-coloured moss; whilst behind it, in the churchyard,
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
spreads the gloom of a yew, which, from the Conqueror&rsquo;s day,
to this hour, has darkened the graves of generations.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a></p>
<p>But the charm of Brockenhurst, as of all the Forest villages,
consists in the Forest itself. To the north runs the small
Forest stream, blossomed over in the summer with water-lilies.
On the left lies Black Knoll, with its waste of heath and gorse,
running up to the young plantations of New Park. On the
right, Balmor Lawn, with its short, sweet turf, where herds
of cattle are pasturing, stretches away to Holland&rsquo;s Wood, with
old thorns scattered here and there, in the spring lighting up
the Forest with their white may.</p>
<p>Just now though, it is the southern part of the Forest we
must see. So going back again for a little way upon the
Beaulieu Road, and leaving it just above the foot-bridge for
Whitley Lodge, let the reader go on to Lady Cross. Suddenly
he will come out upon the northern edge of Beaulieu Heath, and
see again the Island Hills. To the people in the Forest, the
Island is their weather-glass. If its hills look dark blue and
purple, then the weather will be fine; but if they can see the
houses and the chalk quarries on the hill sides, the rain is sure
to come.</p>
<p>Keeping straight on, with Lady Cross Lodge to our left,
we enter Frame Wood, with its turf and its bridle roads winding
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
under the Forest boughs. Down in the bottom runs the railroad
bending away to the north. On the other side, the thick woods
of Denny rise; and the clump of solitary beeches on the top
of the knoll shows the last remains of Wood Fidley, so well
known as having given rise to the Forest proverb of &ldquo;Wood
Fidley rain,&rdquo; that is, rain which lasts all the day.</p>
<p>Here you can wander on for miles, as far as the manor
of Bishop&rsquo;s Ditch, belonging to Winchester College, which the
Forest peasant will tell you was a grant of land as much as
the Bishop of Winchester could in a day crawl round on his
hands and knees. As to losing yourself, never mind. The real
plan to enjoy the Forest is to wander on, careless whether you
lose yourself or not. In fact, I believe the real method is to
try and lose yourself, finding your greatest pleasure in the
unexpected scenes of beauty into which you are led.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other Forest rambles round Brockenhurst
which must not be forgotten. Just at the western edge of
Beaulieu Heath, about three miles off, stands Boldre Church,
with its solitary churchyard surrounded by trees. On one side,
it looks out upon the bare Forest; and on the other, down
into the cultivated valley. Most suggestful, most peaceful is
this twofold prospect, telling us alike both of work and companionship,
as, too, of solitude&mdash;all of them, in religion, so
needful for man. Its tower stands boldly out, almost away
from the church, just between the nave and the chancel,
serving formerly, like Brockenhurst steeple, as a landmark to
the Forest; whilst the long outline of the nave is broken only
by the south porch, and its three dormer windows. Here
Southey married his second wife, Catharine Bowles. And close
to the north side, under the shadow of a maple, lies one of the
truest lovers of Nature&mdash;Gilpin, the author of the <i>Scenery of the</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
<i>New Forest</i>, with a quaint, simple inscription on his gravestone
written by himself. In the church are tablets both to him
and Bromfield, the botanist, a man like him in many ways,
but who, dying abroad, was not allowed to rest beside him in
this quiet graveyard.</p>
<p>The south aisle is the oldest part, with its three Norman
arches rising from square piers, whilst the north aisle is divided
from the nave by a row of Early-English arches springing from
plain black Purbeck marble shafts. In the east window of this
aisle were once painted the arms of the Dauphin of France&mdash;the
fleurs de lis&mdash;blazoned, as they were formerly, over the whole
field, telling us the story of Lewis having been invited to
England and crowned king by John&rsquo;s barons, and whose
traditional flight at Leap has been mentioned.</p>
<p>Down below, in the valley of the Brockenhurst Water, lies
Boldre, the Bovre of <i>Domesday</i>, with its meadows and cornfields.
It is worth while to pause for a moment, and notice the
corruption of Boldre into Bovre by the Norman clerks. The
word is from the Keltic, and signifies the full stream
(&ldquo;<i>y Byldwr</i>&rdquo;), and has nothing to do with oxen. We must,
too, bear in mind that the various Oxenfords and Oxfords are
themselves corruptions, and really come not from oxen at all,
but Usk, literally meaning the stream-ford or stream-road, and
are in no way connected with the various Old-English Rodfords
to be found in different parts of the kingdom. This corruption
of language we see daily going on in our own Colonies, but
it is well to pause and remember that the same process has
taken place in our own country.</p>
<p>Passing over the bridge, and up the village, and under the
railway arch, we once more reach the Forest at Shirley Holms,
coming out on Shirley and Sway Commons. Here again, as on
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Beaulieu Heath, there is not a single tree, nothing but one
vast stretch of heather, which late in the summer covers the
ground with its crimson and amethyst. There is only one
fault to be found with it, that when its glory is past it leaves
so great a blank behind: its grey withered flowers and its grey
scanty foliage forming such a contrast with its previous brightness
and cheerfulness.</p>
<p>But these two commons will at all times be interesting to
the arch&aelig;ologist and historian. On the north-east side lies the
Roydon, that is, the rough ground, a word which we find in
other parts of the Forest; and not far from it is Lichmore or
Latchmore Pond&mdash;the place of corpses&mdash;which is confirmed by
the various adjoining barrows.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a></p>
<p>After this point, there is nothing to attract the traveller,
unless he is a botanist, to the south. Wootton, and Wilverley,
and Setthorns, and Holmsley, are all young plantations, whilst
at Wootton the Forest now entirely ceases, though once stretching
five miles farther, as far as the sea. So let him make his
way to Longslade, or Hinchelsea Bottom, as it is indifferently
called, where about the middle of June blossoms the lesser
bladderwort (<i>Utricularia minor</i>), and about the same time, or
rather later, the floating bur-reed (<i>Sparganeum natans</i>).</p>
<p>Above, rises Hinchelsea Knoll, with its old hollies and
beeches; and still farther to the north the high lands round
Lyndhurst and Stony Cross crowned with woods. Westward,
the heather stretches over plain and hill till it reaches
Burley. Making right through Hinchelsea, and then skirting
the north side of Wilverley plantations, we shall come to the
valley of Holmsley, so beloved by Scott, and which put him
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
in mind of his native moors, without seeing which once a year,
he so pathetically said, he felt as if he should die. Its wild
beauty, however, is in a great measure spoilt by the railroad,
and the large trees which grew in Scott&rsquo;s time have all been
felled.</p>
<p>Burley itself, which now lies just before us, is one of the
most primitive of Forest hamlets, the village suddenly losing
itself amongst the holms and hollies, and then reforming itself
again in some open space. So thoroughly a Forest village,
it is proverbially said to be dependent upon the yearly crop
of acorns and mast, or &ldquo;akermast,&rdquo; as they are collectively
called. To the south-west stands Burley Beacon, where some
entrenchments are still visible, and the fields lying round it
are still called &ldquo;Greater&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lesser Castle Fields,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Barrows,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coffins,&rdquo; showing that the whole district has
once been one vast battle-field.</p>
<p>Close to the village are the Burley quarries, where the
so-called Burley rock, a mere conglomerate of gravel, the
&ldquo;ferrels,&rdquo; or &ldquo;verrels,&rdquo; of North Hampshire, is dug, formerly
used for the foundations of the old Forest churches, as at
Brockenhurst, and Minestead, and Sopley in the Vale of the
Avon. The great woods round Burley have all been cut,
except a few beech-woods, but here and there &ldquo;merry orchards&rdquo;
mingle themselves with the holms and hollies, wandering,
half-wild, amongst the Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a></p>
<p>Turning away from the village, and going north-east, before
us rise great woods&mdash;Old Burley, with its yews and oaks,
where the raven used to build; Vinney Ridge, with its heronry
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
at one extremity, and the Eagle Tree at the other; whilst
behind us are the young Burley plantations. Here, near the
Lodge, scattered in some fields, stand the remains of the
&ldquo;Twelve Apostles,&rdquo; once enormous oaks, reduced both in
number and size, with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t6">&ldquo;Boughs moss&rsquo;d with age,</p>
<p class="t0">And high tops bald with dry antiquity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And now, if the reader does not mind the swamps&mdash;and if he
really wishes to know the Forest, and to see its best scenes, it
is useless to mind them&mdash;let him make his way across to Mark
Ash, the finest beechwood in the Forest, which even on a
summer&rsquo;s day is dark at noon. Thence the wood-cutter&rsquo;s track
will take him by Barrow&rsquo;s Moor and Knyghtwood, where grows
the well-known oak. Here a different scene opens out with
broad spaces of heath and fern, where the gladiolus shows its
red blossoms among the green leaves of the brake; whilst on
the hill, distinguished by its poplars, stands Rhinefield, with its
nursery, and, below, the two woods of Birchen Hat, where the
common buzzard yearly breeds.</p>
<p>Keeping along the main road, which is just before us,
nearly as far as the New Forest Gate, we will turn in at
Liney Hill Wood, going through the woods of Brinken, and
the Queen&rsquo;s Mead, and the Queen&rsquo;s Bower, following the course
of the stream.</p>
<p>Very beautiful is this walk, with its paths which stray down
to the water&rsquo;s edge, where the cattle come to drink; the stream
pausing round some oak roots, which pleach the banks, lingering
in the darkness of the shade, and at last going away with
reluctance.</p>
<p>Few things, of their sort, can equal these lowland Forest
streams, the water tinged with the iron of the district, flashing
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
into amber in the sunlight, and deepening into rich browns in
the shade, making the pebbles hazel as it ripples over them.</p>
<p>All the way along grow oaks and beeches, each guarded
with its green fence of kneeholm, and furred with moss, which
the setting sun paints with bands of light. And so, in turn,
passing Burley and Rhinefield Fords, and Cammel Green, and
the Buckpen, where the deer used to be fed in winter, the path
suddenly comes out by a lonely grass-field, known as the Queen&rsquo;s
Mead, and immediately after enters the Queen&rsquo;s Bower Wood.
At the farther end, a bridge crosses the brook by the side of one
of the many Boldrefords in the Forest; and in the distance,
across Black Knoll, shine the white houses of Brockenhurst.</p>

</div>
<p>As we leave Brockenhurst we find ourselves more and more in
the Forest. The road to Lyndhurst is one long avenue of
trees&mdash;beeches with their smooth trunks, oaks growing in
groups, with here and there long lawns stretching far away
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
into distant woods. Most beautiful is this road in the spring.
Stand on the top of Clay Hill, about the beginning or end of
May, and you shall see wood after wood, masses of colour, the
birches hung with the softest green, and the oak boughs breaking
into amber and olive, made doubly bright by the dark gloom
of firs, the blackthorn giving place to the sweeter may, and the
marigold on the stream to the brighter lily.</p>
<p>On our left lies New Park, now turned into a farm,
where in 1670 Charles II. kept a herd of red deer, brought
from France, but previously used as a pound for stray cattle.
Passing on by a roadside inn with the strange sign of the
&ldquo;Crown and Stirrup,&rdquo; referring to a pseudo-relic of Rufus&rsquo;s,
preserved at the King&rsquo;s House, but which is nothing more than
a stirrup-iron of the sixteenth century, we reach Lyndhurst&mdash;the
lime wood,<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a>
the capital of the Forest, the Linhest of <i>Domesday</i>.</p>
<p>William the Conqueror at one time held the manor, in his
own hands, dependent on that of Amesbury. Here, after the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
afforestation, Herbert the Forester held one yardland, on which
only two borderers lived, the rest of the manor, which was only
two hydes, being thrown into the Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> Here, also, as at
Brockenhurst, was another of the old feudal tenures; for, in
the time of Edward I., William-le-Moyne held probably these
same two hydes of land, which had been disafforested, by the
sergeantry of keeping the door of the King&rsquo;s larder.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>In the village stands the Queen&rsquo;s House, built in Charles II.&rsquo;s
time, and adjoining it is the Hall where the Courts of Attachment,
or Woodmote, the last remnant of the terrible Forest
Laws, are regularly held by the verderers, to try all cases of
stealing fern and timber.</p>
<p>Close by is the new, half-finished, church, standing in the
old churchyard made famous by Mr. Kingsley&rsquo;s ballad. It is
not fair at present to pass a final judgment. When the tower is
added, and time shall have touched the walls with a soberer
tone, its two great defects will have disappeared, though nothing
can remedy the heavy and poverty-stricken window of the north
transept with its flattened mullions, and a wretched chimney
near the choir utterly spoiling the effect of the beautiful chancel
windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Inside, the red brick pillars of the arches of the aisles are
clustered with black slate shafts, and banded with scroll-work of
white Caen stone, the capitals carved with lilies, and primroses,
and violets.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> And above hangs a Perpendicular timbered roof,
resting on the corbel heads of the martyrs and reformers of the
Church&mdash;of Melancthon and Cranmer, and Luther and Latimer,&mdash;and
the carved emblems of the Evangelists at the four
corners.</p>
<p>In the choir and chancel the wall-colouring is more harmonious
than in the nave, where there is a certain coldness and
hardness, whilst the shafts are here wrought of rich Cornish
marble. Over the communion-table is Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s fresco,
a small piece of it now only completed&mdash;an angel standing with
outstretched hands, keeping back those virgins who have come
too late to the bridegroom&rsquo;s feast, the despair and anguish of
their faces further typified by the rent wall, and the melancholy
dreariness of the owl.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>That there are defects in the church its greatest admirers
would admit&mdash;the poorness of the roof, the harshness produced
by the introduction of so much white, as also the bad colour of
the bricks, and a heaviness which hangs over the clerestory
windows of the nave. But, on the whole, it stands as a proof
of the great advance during the last ten years of Art, as a
cheering sign, too, that, amidst all the failures of Government,
some taste and zeal are to be found amongst private persons.</p>
<p>There is nothing else of interest in the village. Once here
busy scenes must have taken place, when the King came to
hunt with his retinue of nobles; when down the street poured
the train of bow-bearers, and foresters, and keepers, clad in
doublets of Lincoln green, holding the dogs in leash. Then
the woods rang with the notes of the bugle, and the twang of the
bow-string sounded as the bolt, or the good English yard-shaft,
brought down the quarry. Here, too, in the Civil War, were
quartered grim Puritan soldiers, and prayers took the place
of feasts.<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a> Now, all is quiet. Nothing is to be seen but
the Forest inviting us into its green glades.</p>
<p>The people of Lyndhurst ought, I always think, to be
the happiest and most contented in England, for they possess a
wider park and nobler trees than even Royalty. You cannot
leave the place in any direction without going through the
Forest. To the east lie the great woods of Denny and Ashurst;
and to the north rise Cutwalk and Emery Down, looking across
the vale to Minestead, and below them Kitt&rsquo;s Hill, and the woods
stretching away towards Alum Green. On the extreme west
Mark Ash, and Gibb&rsquo;s Hill, and Boldrewood, rise towering one
after the other; whilst to the south stretch Gretnam and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
Great and Little Huntley Woods, which the Millaford Brook
skirts, here and there flowing out from the darkness of the
trees into the sunshine, the banks scooped into holes, and
held together only by the rope-work of roots.</p>
<p>These woods are always beautiful. Of their loveliness in
spring we have spoken; and if you come to them in summer,
then the first purple of the heather flaunts on every bank, and
edges the sides of the gravel-pits with a crimson fringe; and
the streams now idle, suffer themselves to be stopped up with
water-lilies and white crowfoot, whilst the mock-myrtle dips
itself far into the water. Then is it you may know something
of the sweetness and the solitude of the woods, and wandering
on, giving the day up to profitable idleness, can attain to that
mood of which Wordsworth constantly sings, as teaching more
than all books or years of study.</p>

</div>
<p>About four miles off from Lyndhurst lie Minestead and Rufus&rsquo;s
Stone. There are three or four different roads to them.
The most beautiful, though the longest, is over Emery
Down, where, turning off to the left, you pass the woods
of Kitt&rsquo;s Hill, and James Hill. Then crossing Millaford
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Bridge, and skirting on each side of the road the beeches of
Holme Hill, and passing through Boldrewood, you make your
way eastward across the stream below the Withy Bed Hat, and
go through the woods of Puckpits and Stonehard.</p>
<p>Another road to the Stone is through Minestead by a footpath
which crosses Mr. Compton&rsquo;s park, dotted with cottages,
each with its garden full in the summer and autumn of flowers&mdash;yellow
Aaron-rods, pink candy-tufts, colchicums, and marigolds,
and tall sheaves of grey Michaelmas daisies.</p>
<p>In the village stands &ldquo;The Faithful Servant,&rdquo; copied from
the well-known picture at Winchester College. A little farther
on we ascend Stoneycross Hill, the village orchards full of Mary-apples
and Morrisses mingling their blossoms, in the spring,
with the green Forest oaks. As we reach the top, suddenly
there opens out one long view. On the north-east rise the hills
beyond Winchester; but the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; is hidden in their
valley. To the east lies Southampton, with its houses by the
water-side; and to the north, across the woods of Prior&rsquo;s Acre,
gleam the green Wiltshire downs lit up by the sunlight.</p>
<p>Close to us, among its beeches, lies Castle Malwood, with
its single trench and Forest lodge, where tradition and poets say
Rufus feasted before his death; and down in the valley stands
the Stone which marks the spot where he is said to have fallen.</p>
<p>It will be as well to repeat the story, as told by the two
Chroniclers who give the fullest account, with all its omens and
apparitions. The King had gone to bed on the evening of the
1st of August, and was suddenly awoke by a fearful vision.
He dreamt that he was bled, and the stream of blood, pouring
up to heaven, clouded the very day. His attendants, hearing
his cries to the Virgin, rushed in with lights, and stayed with
him all that night. Morning dawned: and Robert Fitz Hamon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
his special friend, came to him with another dream, dreamt
also that very night by a foreign monk then staying at the
court, who had seen the King enter a church, and there seize
the rood, tearing apart its legs and arms. For a time the image
bore the insult, but suddenly struck the King. He fell, and
flames and smoke issued from his mouth, putting out the light
of the stars. The Red King&rsquo;s courage, however, had by this
time returned. With a laugh, he cried, &ldquo;He is a monk, and
dreams for money like a monk: give him this,&rdquo; handing
Fitz Hamon a hundred shillings. Still the two dreams had
their effect, and William hesitated to test their truth.<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> At
dinner that day he drank more than usual. His spirits once
more returned. He defied the dreams. In spite of their
warnings, he determined to hunt. As he was preparing, his
armourer approached with six brand-new arrows. Choosing out
two, he cried, as he gave them to Walter Tiril, Lord of Poix
and Pontoise, who had lately come from Normandy, &ldquo;The best
arrows to the best marksman.&rdquo; The small hunting-party,
consisting of his brother Henry, William of Breteuil, Walter
Tiril, and Fitz Hamon, and a few more, set out. As they are
leaving the courtyard, a monk from St. Peter&rsquo;s Abbey at
Gloucester arrives. He gives the King a letter from Serlo, the
abbot. It told how a monk of that abbey had dreamt that
he had seen the Saviour and all the host of heaven standing
round the great white throne. Then, too, came the Virgin
robed in light, and flung herself at the feet of her Son, and
prayed Him, by his precious blood and agony on the cross, to
take pity on the English; prayed Him, too, as He was judge
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
of all men, and avenger of all wickedness, to punish the King.
The Saviour answered her, &ldquo;You must be patient and wait:
due retribution will in time befall the wicked.&rdquo; The King read
it and laughed. &ldquo;Does Serlo,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;think that I believe
the visions of every snoring monk? Does he take me for an
Englishman, who puts faith in the dreams of every old
woman?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> With this the party once more sets out into the
Forest, the woods still green with all their deep summer
foliage.</p>
<p>So they hunted all that noon and afternoon. The sun was
now setting. Tiril and the King were alone.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> A stag bounded
by: the King shot and slightly wounded the quarry. On,
though, it still bounded in the full light of the setting sun.
The King stood watching it, shading his eyes with his hands.
At that moment another deer broke cover. Tiril this time
shot, and the shaft lodged itself in the King&rsquo;s breast.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> He
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
fell without a word or groan, vainly trying to pull out the
arrow, which broke short in his hand.</p>
<p>Thus perished William the Red. Tiril leapt on his horse.
Henry galloped to Winchester, and the other nobles to their
houses. One exception was there. William of Breteuil, following
hard upon Henry to Winchester, honourably declared
the rights of the absent Robert, to whom both Henry and
himself had sworn fealty. William&rsquo;s body was brought on a
cart to the cathedral, the blood from his wound reddening the
road.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> There the next morning<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> he was buried, unlamented,
unknelled, and unaneled.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a></p>

</div>
<p>So runs the story as told by the Chroniclers. And to this
day popular tradition not only repeats their tale, but points to
the places associated with the event. Below our feet lies the
lonely glen of Canterton, where the King is said to have fallen.
The oak from which, as the legend runs, the arrow glanced, is
long since dead, but a stone marks its site, now capped over with
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
a hideous cast-iron case.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> In the woods and in the village of
Minestead still live some of the descendants of Purkess, who is
reported to have carried the bleeding corpse in his charcoal-cart
to Winchester along the road now known as the King&rsquo;s Road.
Twelve miles away, on the extreme south-west boundary of the
Forest, close to the Avon, stands a smithy, on the site of the
one where, the legend says, Walter Tiril&rsquo;s horse was shod, and
which, for that reason, to this day pays a yearly fine to the
Crown: and the water close by, where the fugitive passed, is
still called Tyrrel&rsquo;s Ford. And Rufus lies in Winchester
Cathedral, his bones now mixed with those of Canute; and
under a marble tomb, in the south aisle of the presbytery,
sleeps his brother Richard, slain also like himself in the Forest.</p>
<p>So runs the story, unquestioned save here and there by some
few faint doubts.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> As to the tradition, I think we may at once
set aside its testimony. The value of mere tradition in history
weighs, or ought to weigh, nothing. Here and there tradition
may be true in a very general sense, as when it says the Isle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Wight was once joined to Hampshire; but it is never particular
in its dates, and is ever in too much hurry to compare facts.
Tradition, as often as not, kills the murderer instead of the
murdered; and makes the man who built the place to have
been born there. Tradition is, in fact, the history of the vulgar,
and the stumbling-block of the half-learned.</p>
<p>We will look at the broader bearings of the case. The first
thing which strikes us is the fact that two other very near relatives
of the Red King, his brother and his nephew, also lost
their lives by so-called accidents in the New Forest. If we
are to believe the Chroniclers, his brother Richard met his death
whilst hunting there, according to one narrative, by a pestilential
blast&mdash;surely, at the least, a very unsatisfactory
account;<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> though,
by another version, from the effects of a blow against a
tree.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a>
His nephew Richard was either wounded by an arrow through
the neck, or caught by the boughs of a tree and strangled&mdash;a
still more improbable death;<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> whilst, according to Florence
of Worcester, he was killed by the arrow of one of his own
knights.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> We will only here pause to notice not only the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
extreme improbability, but the contradictory statements in both
cases, which will not, of course, increase the value of the same
evidence concerning Rufus.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a></p>
<p>And now we will examine the version of his death. History
is at all times subjective enough, but becomes far more so when
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
written by unfriendly Chroniclers, who have good reasons for
suppressing the truth. The story reads at the very first glance
too much like a romance. In the first place, we have no less
than three dreams, which are always effects rather than causes&mdash;after-thoughts
rather than prophecies, well fitted to suit the
superstition of the times, and to deceive the crowd. Then,
too, we find the old device of the armourer craving the King
to take six brand-new arrows, by one of which at the hand of
his friend he is fated to fall on the very spot which his father
had laid waste, and where he is said to have destroyed a
church.</p>
<p>It may of course be urged that all this is in accordance with
what we know of the eternal power of the moral laws, that the
sins of the fathers are ever visited upon the sons to the third
and fourth generations, and that time ever completes the full
circle of retribution. But the flaw is, that this special judgment
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
is too special. &ldquo;Divine vengeance&rdquo; and &ldquo;judgment of God,&rdquo;
the Chroniclers cry out one after another, and this is thought
sufficient to account for three so-called accidental deaths. The
moral laws, however, never fall so directly as they are here
represented. Their influence is more oblique. The lightning of
justice does not immediately follow each peal of suffering.</p>
<p>Leaving, however, the Chroniclers&rsquo; views to themselves, let
us look further at some of the facts which peep out in the
narrative. Why, in the first place, we naturally ask, if the
King was shot by accident, did his friends and attendants
desert him? Why was he brought home in a cart, drawn by
a wretched jade, the blood, not even staunched, flowing from
the wound, clotting the dust on the road? Why, too, the
indecent haste of his funeral? Why, afterwards, was no inquiry
as to his death made? Why, too, was Tiril&rsquo;s conduct not
investigated? These questions are difficult to answer, except
upon one supposition.</p>
<p>Let us note, also, that they are all ecclesiastics, to whom
the revelations of the King&rsquo;s speedy end had been made known,
and that their special favourite, Henry, succeeded to the throne in
spite of his elder brother&rsquo;s right. It is, certainly, too, something
more than singular that when the banished Anselm should visit
Hugh, Abbot of Cluny, that the Abbot should tell him that during
the past night he had seen William summoned before God
and sentenced to damnation, and that the King&rsquo;s death immediately
followed: that further, on the next day, when he went
to Lyons, his chaplain should be twice told by a youth of
the death of William before it took
place.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> More than singular,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
too, are those words of Fulchered, spoken so openly and so daringly,
&ldquo;The bow of God&rsquo;s vengeance is bent against the wicked;
and the arrow swift to wound is already drawn out of the
quiver.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>Either all these persons were prophets, or accessories to the
murder, or&mdash;for there is one more solution&mdash;the Chroniclers
invented this portion of the story. If we admit this last supposition,
we cannot receive the other parts of the narrative without
the greatest suspicion. We have almost a sufficient warrant
to read them in an exactly opposite sense to what they were
intended to bear.</p>
<p>Let us remember, also, that Flambard, Rufus&rsquo;s prime
minister, who was universally hated by the clergy, and who had
lately banished Godric, of Christchurch, into Normandy, was
instantly stripped of his possessions by Henry, and Godric
reinstated, and the banished Anselm recalled; and, lastly,
and most important of all, that Tiril, who had just arrived
from Normandy, was a friend of Anselm&rsquo;s,<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a> and, further, that
Alanus de Insulis, better known as le Docteur Universel, who
lived not long after the event, actually says that in his opinion
it was caused by treachery.<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> Surely all these facts and coincidences
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
point but one way. All tend to show, as plainly as
possible, that Rufus fell by no chance, but by a conspiracy of
his prelates, who held the crozier in one, and the battle-axe
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
in the other hand.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a> The cause of their hatred is at once
supplied by his refusing to pay St. Peter&rsquo;s pence&mdash;denying the
Pope&rsquo;s supremacy&mdash;banishing Anselm&mdash;promoting Flambard&mdash;holding
all the bishoprics and other offices which fell vacant<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a>&mdash;by
his cruelties to their different orders at Canterbury and
Crowland, and throughout England, whose enmity died not with
his death, but made them believe that the tower of Winchester
Cathedral fell because they allowed him to be buried in its
nave.</p>
<p>Reading, in the Chroniclers, the life of the Red King seems
like rather reading a series of plots against it, not by the
English, who were too thoroughly cowed to make the slightest
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
resistance, but by his own prelates and barons.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a> His uncle Odo,
Bishop of Bayeux, headed the first rebellion against him, as soon
as he usurped the throne. William, Bishop of Durham, his
own Minister, conspired against him. Bishop Gosfrith, with
his nephew Robert, Earl of Northumberland, rebelled in the
west. Roger Montgomery rose on the Welsh Marches. Roger
Bigod in the eastern, and Hugo of Grentemesnil in the Midland
Counties hoisted the flag of revolt.<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a> Such was England at the
beginning of his reign. In 1096, his own godfather, William of
Aldrey, justly or unjustly, was accused of treason, and died on
the gallows.<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a> William, Count of Eu, kinsman to the King,
suffered a worse fate for the same crime. His steward, William,
also a kinsman of the King&rsquo;s, was hung on a rood. Eudes,
Count of Champagne, forfeited his lands. Others not only
shared the same fate, but were deprived of their eyesight.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> His
northern barons, headed by Robert of Mowbray, goaded to
desperation by the Forest Laws, rose in revolt. Roger of Yvery,
son of the Conqueror&rsquo;s favourite, led the Midland barons, and
was obliged to fly, and all his vast estates, close to the
New Forest, forfeited. Normandy, from whence Tiril had just
come, swarmed with outlawed enemies, both churchmen and
laymen. It was the nest where all the plots could be safely
hatched.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, knowing, too, that the conspiracies became
more frequent as his tyranny increased, we can scarcely avoid
coming to but one conclusion as to his death.</p>
<p>It might suit the policy of the times to throw the guilt
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
on Tiril, but Tiril certainly did not shoot the arrow. We
have his own most solemn declaration to various people, and
especially, not once but often, to Suger, the well-known Abbot
of St. Denis, when he had nothing to gain or lose, that he
had on the day of the King&rsquo;s death not only not entered
that part of the Forest, but had not so much as even seen
him.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
<p>Tiril, however, was certainly implicated in the plot. His
haste to leave the country arose, probably, not so much from
a wish to escape as to convey the news of the success to
Normandy: and popular tradition mistaking the cause, with its
usual inaccuracy, fixed on the wrong person as the assassin.
In after years, however, from some scruple of conscience, he
expiated his share in the murder by a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land.</p>
<p>Who shot the fatal arrow we know not, and, perhaps, shall
never know. We must not expect to get truth in history,&mdash;only,
at the best, some faint glimmering. All is here confusion
and darkness. John of Salisbury, who lived about the middle
of the twelfth century, says it was as little known who killed
the King as who slew Julian the Apostate.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a> The very spot
where he fell is doubtful. One thing, however, seems certain,
that he was slain, not, as the Chroniclers say, because his
father made the New Forest, but through his own cruelties and
excesses, by which he outraged both friend and foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>It is not single passages which alone leave this impression,
but still more the cumulative force of the evidence. The fact
that all were gainers by his death, and the general abhorrence of
the tyrant, are in themselves strong reasons. Not one, but all
parties were bound together against him by the strongest of
covenants&mdash;hatred. The marked and bitter prophecies, which
would not have been uttered were not their fulfilment ensured,&mdash;the
suspicious silence on all important points,&mdash;the pretended
dreams and omens,&mdash;the abandonment of the body,&mdash;the want
of any inquiry into the cause of death,&mdash;the connection between
the Church party and Anselm with Henry I., and Anselm&rsquo;s
connection again with Tiril, all serve to show the depth and
darkness of the plot.</p>
<p>His life throws the best light on his death. Read by it,
by the extortions and atrocities which he committed, by the
universal hatred in which he was held, the conclusion is inevitable.
Years of violence were the prelude to a violent end.
The many failures in open revolt seem only to have taught the
lesson of greater caution. And treachery at last succeeded,
where plain courage had so often failed.</p>
<p>Direct proof of the murder cannot be had, and must not be
expected. Every one was interested in keeping that a secret
by which all alike profited. To have declared it, would have
covered the Crown with disgrace, and stained the hands of the
Church.</p>
<p>Their own absurdities and contradictions form the best
refutation of the common accounts. In details they are irreconcilable
with each other. According to one, the King was
alone with Tiril; to another, with all his attendants. One
narrative declares that the arrow glanced from a boar, a second
from a stag, a third from a tree. Even if we accept them, then
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
either the power of prophecy lasted much longer than is commonly
supposed, or, as we have said, the clergy were accessories
to the murder;&mdash;we have no other choice. The last of these
solutions is fatal to the common belief; and very few persons
would, I suppose, venture upon the first. Nevertheless, the
monk of Gloucester&rsquo;s dream was not yet to be fulfilled. The
hour was not yet at hand for England&rsquo;s deliverance. As the
Parliamentary party said in Charles the First&rsquo;s time&mdash;&ldquo;Things
must become worse before they can mend.&rdquo; England had,
therefore, to undergo a tyranny for more than a century longer&mdash;till
the evil became its own cure. Good was at length accomplished.
Out of all the woe and wretchedness came the Bill
of Rights and the Charta de Forest&acirc;.</p>

</div>
<p>If any one wishes to know the beauty of the Forest in autumn,
let him see the view from the high ridge at Stoney-Cross.
Here the air blows off the Wiltshire Downs finer and keener
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
than anywhere else. Here, on all sides, stretch woods and
moors. Here, in the latter end of August, the three heathers,
one after another, cover every plain and holt with their crimson
glory, mixed with the flashes of the dwarf furze. And a little
later the maples are dyed, yellow and russet, by the autumn
rains, and the beeches are scorched to a fiery red with the first
frost, and the oaks renew, but deeper and more gloriously, the
golden lights of spring, till the great woods of Prior&rsquo;s Acre
and Daneshill burn with colour; every gleam of sunshine, and
every passing shadow, touching them with fresher and stranger
beauty.</p>
<p>To the east, about two miles along the Southampton Road,
lies the village of Cadenham, famous for its oak, which, like the
Glastonbury thorn, buds on Christmas Eve. The popular
tradition in the neighbourhood runs, that, as the weather
is harder, it shows more leaves, and, refusing the present
chronology, only buds on Old Christmas night. As in most
things, there is some little truth in the story. Doubtless, in
some of the mild winters which visit Hampshire, the tree shows
a few buds, as at that time I have seen others do in various
parts of the Forest. Of course, they are all nipped by the
first approach of severe weather, which, however, seldom happens
on the warm south-west coast till the new year.</p>
<p>Down in the valley to the left of Rufus&rsquo;s Stone rise the
woods of the Long Beeches, and Prior&rsquo;s Acre, and Daneshill
or Dean&rsquo;s Hell, where the word Hell (from <i>helan</i>, to
cover) means nothing more than the dark place, like the Hellbecks
in Yorkshire.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a> Beaten paths and walks stretch into
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the woods in every direction. Perhaps one of the prettiest is
over Coalmeer Brook, and then through the thick beeches of
Coalmeer Wood, where the honey buzzard builds, till we come
to the King&rsquo;s Gairn stream, where the Bracklesham Clays,
teeming with fossils, may, by digging, be reached.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<p>Brook Common now opens before us. At its farther end
stands Brook Wood, with its fine hollies and durmast oaks
(<i>Quercus sessiliflora</i>). Passing the High Beeches to our left, we
reach Shepherd&rsquo;s Gutter, a small stream, where the Bracklesham
beds again crop out with their blue and slate-coloured
clays.</p>
<p>Going on through more woods, and then by clumps of old
hollies and yews, we come to Bramble Hill. Perhaps, just
above the Lodge, on the top of the hill, we gain the most extensive
view of the Forest. Before us spreads one vast sea of
woods, broken in the front by Malwood Ridge, and Brochis
Hill, and then rolling its flood of green over Minestead Valley,
and rising again wave-like, at Whitley, till lost among the moors,
whilst the Isle of Wight hills seam the blue sky with their dark
outlines.</p>
<p>The village of Bramshaw, just a little way beyond, stands
partly in both Hampshire and Wiltshire, and forms the Forest
boundary. From its woods in former times the shingles for
roofing Salisbury Cathedral were cut. Its church, although
prettily situated, is scarcely worth seeing. Only an Early-English
window at the east end, and an arch on the south side,
remain of the old building, now defaced by every variety of
modern ugliness. In the churchyard stands a fine yew; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
a buttress on the north side is completely covered with the
lovely common spleenwort.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill26">
<img id="fig26" src="images/image112.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="731" />
<p class="pcap">View in Puckpits.</p>
</div>
<p>Coming back, however, to Stoney-Cross, we will now go
westward. Stoney-Cross itself consists of but a few tumbledown
cottages, inhabited principally by the Forest workmen.
Just beyond the last of them let us stop for a moment. To
the south stretch more woods&mdash;Stonehard, with its views across
the valley, to the oaks of Wick and the plain of Acres Down,
looking over Rhinefield and the valley of the Osmanby Ford,
beyond Wootton, to the Needle Rocks, mass upon mass of
woods. To the right of it lies Puckpits, where the badger
breeds, and the raven used to build, and where still on a
summer morning the honey buzzard comes flying up from
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
Mark Ash, and, circling for hours round the trees, will again
fly back to its favourite haunt.</p>
<p>All these woods there are for rambles, flushed in the spring
with wood-anemones and wood-sorrel, set in the green moss
and the greener heather of the bilberry. Nowhere, too, in the
Forest, than in these woods, have I seen more lovely sunsets.
Through some deep-cut oriel of the trees have I watched the
sun begin to sink, each moment burning brighter, and then
suddenly its great brand of fire would fall, reddening each
tree trunk, and crimson billows of clouds come rolling eastward.</p>
<p>Instead of following the Ringwood Road, beautiful as that
is in many parts, especially at Woody Bratley, with its old
thorn trees, we will turn off to the right. To the west now
rises Ocknell Wood, and its clump of firs, a well-known landmark,
and beyond that lies the new Slufter Inclosure, and
Bratley Plain, with its great graveyard of barrows. In front of
us stretches the East Fritham Plain, with its three barrows,
locally called &ldquo;butts,&rdquo; the central known as Reachmore. At the
second mound we will go into North Bentley Wood, following
the wood-cutter&rsquo;s track. Very wild and unfrequented is this.
Here a stray deer will bound across the road; and sometimes a
small herd of as many as six or seven are browsing on the ivy
clinging to some tree just felled, startled at the slightest sound,
and trooping off down the glades. The grey hen rises up at
our feet from the heather; and, as we enter the wood, the
woodpecker shrieks out his shrill laugh, whilst a buzzard is
heavily sailing over the trees.</p>
<p>The road winds on through the valley amongst oaks flecked
with silver flakes of moss, broken here and there by open glades
and green spaces of fern. At last, we reach Queen&rsquo;s North Lawn,
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
which leads us on the right to Fritham, standing on the hill top.
In the valley below lies Eyeworth Lodge, with the powder mills
lately built; the Ivare of <i>Domesday</i>, and still so called by the
peasantry, afterwards <i>Yvez</i>, where Roger Beteston, in the reign
of Henry III., held some land by the service of finding litter
for the King&rsquo;s bed and hay for his horse whenever he came
here to hunt.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
<p>Fritham is thoroughly in the Forest; and few spots can
equal it in interest. It may be the very place where Rufus fell:<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a>
but whether or no, close round it lie the barrows of the Kelt,
and the potteries of the Roman, covering acres of ground, at
Island&rsquo;s Thorn and Crockle, and Sloden and Black Bar, with the
banks which mark the sites of the workmen&rsquo;s houses.<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> Close
round it, too, encircling it on all sides, rise the woods of
Studley, with their great beeches, and Eyeworth, famous for its
well. Going along the West Fritham Plain we come to Sloden,
with its thick wood of yews, standing, massive and black, in all
their depth of foliage, mixed, in loveliest contrast, with clumps
of whitebeams. Below runs the brook, flowing under Amberwood,
and winding among dark groups of hollies, lost at
last in the deep gorge, shut in by the hills of Goreley and
Charlford.</p>
<p>The best way to reach Fordingbridge is either to go by
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Ashley Lodge, and so through Pitt&rsquo;s Wood, and between the
high, bare, half mountainous hills of Chilly and Blissford,
coming out upon the turnpike-road near Blissford Gate; or to
follow the side of the Amberwood stream towards some scattered
houses, called Ogdens.</p>
<p>Here we leave the Forest, and its moors and woods, and,
mounting Goreley Hill, see below us the church of Fordingbridge,
and the Avon winding among its meadows. To the
south Hengistbury Head lifts itself up in the distant horizon;
and beyond it again, but more to the west, stretches the blue
line of the Portland Hills. To the north swell the rounded
forms of the Wiltshire downs, and the spire of Salisbury
starts out from the midst, and behind it towers the mound
of Old Sarum.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Valley of the Avon from Castle Hill.</p>
</div>
<p>The Valley of the Avon should certainly be seen, both because
large parts of its manors and villages once stood in the
Forest, as also for the contrast which it now affords to the
neighbouring Forest scenery. Nothing can be so different to the
moors we have just left as the Valley. Though close to them,
you might imagine you were suddenly transported into one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
the Midland Counties, and were walking by the side of the
Warwickshire, instead of the Wiltshire Avon. In the place of
wild heathery commons and furzy holts, deep lanes wind along
by comfortable homesteads, thatched with Dorsetshire reed.
Instead, too, of dark oak and beech woods, thick hedges are
white in the spring with the scattered spray of the blackthorn,
and orchards glow with their crimson wreaths of flowers.</p>
<p>Fordingbridge, formerly nothing else but Forde, now known
to all fishermen for its pike and trout, in former days held
the high-road into the Forest. On the bridge the lord of the
manor, during the fence months, was obliged to mount guard,
and stop all suspected persons, who could only on the north-west
leave the Forest this way.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>
<p>In <i>Domesday</i> its manor possessed a church and two mills,
rented at 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> Though all its beech and oak woods, worth,
on account of the pannage for swine, 20<i>s.</i> a year, were afforested,
only three virgates of land were taken. Yet, notwithstanding
this loss, it still paid the same rental as in Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s
reign.</p>
<p>The old hospital, dedicated to St. John, was dissolved by
Henry VI., and its revenues annexed to St. Cross, near
Winchester.<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> The church stands on the extreme south-west
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
side of the town, with its avenue of limes, and its yews, now
spoilt by being clipt. The windows of the nave are Early
Decorated, whilst those of the clerestory are Perpendicular.
Against the north pillar of the south chancel arch is fixed a
late brass. The upper part of the east window is spoilt by its
ugly Tudor headings, and the lower portion by the Commandment
tables. The high-pitched open Perpendicular roof of the north
chancel, however, possesses some real interest, both on account
of its height and its richness of detail,&mdash;the tie-beams faced
with mouldings, and the spaces above ornamented with tracery,
and the braces below also carved, and the purlins enriched with
bosses, whilst carved projecting figures bear up the whole.</p>
<p>Before, however, the traveller leaves Fordingbridge he should
go to Sandyballs and Castle Hill, where are still the remains
of a camp, and traces of habitations, probably used in turn
by Kelts, Romans, and West-Saxons, and where, perhaps,
Ambrosius entrenched himself before the battle of Charford.
From here is one of the best views of the Valley. Behind us
stands Godshill inclosure, and the Forest with its dark moors
and woods. Below winds the Avon, with its orchards nestling
on the hill side, stretching its silver coil of waters along the
green meadows, the sunlight gleaming on each bend and turn.</p>
<p>Looking up the stream, the village of Wood Green, and the
woods of Hale, and the two Charfords, one by one appear.
Charford is especially noticeable, formerly Cerdeford, without
doubt the Cerdices-ford of <i>The Chronicle</i> and of Florence. Here
it was for the last time that the gallant Ambrosius Aurelianus,
Prince Natan-Leod, father of the great Arthur of Medi&aelig;val
legends, after his many defeats, rallied the forlorn hope of the
Romanized Kelts. Here, too, he fell on the greensward by the
side of the Avon, with five thousand of his men, and was buried
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
at Amesbury, which still preserves his name. Of the battle we
know nothing&mdash;know only this, that the Keltic power in Wessex
was broken, and that from henceforth the land from Winchester
to Charford was called Natan-lea.<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a></p>
<p>Close to Charford lies Breamore,&mdash;the last of the Forest
manors to the north-west mentioned in <i>Domesday</i><a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a>&mdash;with the
ruins of its fine Elizabethan hall, burnt down only a few years
since, and its church standing in a graveyard full of old yews
and laurels. The church has been most shamefully disfigured&mdash;stuccoed
outside, and whitewashed within. Still it is worth
seeing. A Norman doorway, another proof that the Conqueror
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
did not destroy every church in the district, stands inside the
south porch. A piscina, and brackets for images, still remain in
the chancel.</p>
<p>Returning to Fordingbridge we pass through Burgate,
formerly belonging to Beaulieu Abbey, where the dogs of the
Lord of the Manor, like those of the Abbot of the Monastery,
were allowed to go &ldquo;unlawed.&rdquo; The base of the old village
cross still remains, but the head was, not long ago, broken to
pieces to mend the roads.</p>
<p>Our way from Fordingbridge lies by the side of the Avon,
with the new chapel of Hyde or Hungerford standing on the top
of the Forest range of hills. The road soon brings us to
Ibbesley, the prettiest of villages in the Valley, with its cottages
by the road-side, and their gardens of roses and poppies and
sweet pease, and their porches thatched with honeysuckle. Three
great elms overhang the river, spanned by the single arch of
its bridge; whilst the stream pours sparkling and foaming over
the weir into the water-meadows, and in the distance the tower
of Harbridge rises out from its trees.</p>
<p>The sketch which is given at the end of this chapter is taken
lower down in the fields, and shows another view not so well
known. But the whole river is here full of beauty, winding,
scarce knowing where, among the flat meadows, one stream
flowing one way, and one another, and then all suddenly uniting,
coming up with their joined force against the steep banks, dark
in the shade of the trees; and, being repulsed, flowing away
again into the meadows, white with flocks of swans, and fenced
in by green hedges of rushes and yellow flags.</p>
<p>Going on we reach the avenue of elms which brings us to
the Ellingham cross roads. Turning up the lane to the left we
presently come to Moyles Court, just on the boundary of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
Forest, looking out upon the woods of Newlyns and Chartley.
Here lived Alice Lisle, and here are shown the hiding-places
where, after the battle of Sedgemoor, she concealed Hicks and
Nelthorpe. The house is sadly out of repair; the oak floors,
and part of the fine old staircase, and the wainscoting of many
of the rooms have been taken away; the old tapestry is destroyed
and the iron gates rusted and broken. Still the private chapel
remains, with its panelling and carved string-course of heads,
and its &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; over the place where the altar once stood.<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></p>
<p>The story of Alice Lisle needs not to be told. She was
found guilty of high treason not by the jury, but by the judge,&mdash;the
infamous Jeffreys,&mdash;and was condemned, for an act of
Christian kindness, to worse than a felon&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In Ellingham churchyard, close to the south porch, stands
a plain brick tomb under which she, and her daughter Anne
Hartell, lie, with the simple words, &ldquo;Alicia Lisle dyed the
second of September, 1685;&rdquo; and round the tomb, weaving its
ever green chaplet, grows the little rue-leaved spleenwort.</p>
<p>But a nobler monument has been raised to her in our Houses
of Parliament. In the Commons&rsquo; corridor she stands, bent
with age, resting on her staff, with a gentle placidness shining
in her face, unmoved by any fears for the future, but caring
only to do what her heart feels to be right; whilst on the
opposite wall, painted by the same hand, lives another of those
Englishwomen of whom we may be proud,&mdash;Jane Lane, who,
in her loyalty, would as willingly have sacrificed herself for one
of the most ungrateful of princes, as Alice Lisle for the poor
Puritans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>And about eight miles away, across the Avon, in Dorsetshire,
between two fields on Woodlands Farm, runs an old-fashioned
double hedge, the central ditch choked up with hazel, and
holly, and the common brake. About midway down, half in
the ditch and half in the hedge, stands a pollarded ash,
now bored into holes by the woodpeckers. This is Monmouth&rsquo;s
Ash, and close to it, in the ditch, the duke, the miserable
cause of so much misery, was seized, hid among the fern and
brambles.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></p>
<p>To the ecclesiologist the little church of Ellingham
(Adeling&rsquo;s hamlet) is full of interest. Within stands the old
covered carved pew of Moyles Court, and a monument to one
of its former owners. The plain rood-screen, with the stand
for the hour-glass, and the marks of the pulpit still remain,
formerly, as we can still see, painted blue like the chancel. On
the south wall traces of the staircase to the rood-loft, as well
as the entrance from the outside, are also still visible. In the
chancel the Early-English windows have been sadly mutilated.
Over the communion-table hangs a picture of the Day of
Judgment, plundered from some church in Port St. Mary, in
the Bay of Cadiz, whose bad execution is only exceeded by its
indecent materialism. In the south chancel wall is a double
piscina. On the walls above the rood-screen, the twenty-first
verse of the twenty-fourth chapter of Proverbs, and the twenty-fourth
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
verse of the third chapter of Galatians, according to the
version of the Geneva Bible, are roughly painted.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>As in all the other churches of the district, the churchwardens
have here from time to time shown their natural
attachment to ugliness. The Early-English triplet at the east
end has been blocked up, the gravestones in the chancel defaced,
and a brick porch patched on at the south side.</p>
<p>The road now winds on by low water-meadows, pastured by
herds of cattle, past Blashford Green, till we reach Ringwood,
the Rinwede of <i>Domesday</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> Here, at the Grammar School,
was Stillingfleet educated. Here Monmouth wrote his three
craven letters to James, the Queen Dowager, and the Lord
Treasurer, imploring them to save that life which it was a
disgrace to own.</p>
<p>The old church has been pulled down, and a new one,
modelled in every particular after it, has been built on its site.
A church ought doubtless to tell its own date by its style. Yet
it is far better that we should copy a moderately good specimen
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
than increase the number of modern abortions. At all
events, this is faithfully restored, though utterly spoilt by the
heavy galleries which flank it on every side. The Early-English
chancel, with its recessed arcade, springing from polished shafts
of black Purbeck marble, well shows the beauty of the original
design; whilst, on the chancel floor, lies a fine brass of the
fifteenth century to John Prophete, which, however, has been
most shamefully defaced. The body is robed in a cope broidered
with figures of saints&mdash;St. Michael, and the Virgin and Child,
St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Catharine and St. Faith, St. George
and St. Wenefride. The head, with the hood thrown back,
rests on a cushion, whilst the cope is clasped with a morse,
enriched with an effigy of the Saviour, crowned with a halo of
light.</p>

<p class="pcap">Tyrrel&rsquo;s Ford.</p>
</div>
<p>After we leave Ringwood the road for a mile or two is less
attractive in its scenery. Still, here, as in every part of
England, there is something to be seen and learnt. The Avon
flows close by, famous for a peculiar eel, locally called the
&ldquo;sniggle&rdquo; (<i>Anguilla mediorostris</i>), which differs from its common
congener (<i>acutirostris</i>) in its slender form and elongated under-jaw,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
and its habits of roving and feeding by day.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a> The river has, also,
like some of the Norwegian streams, the peculiarity of forming
ground ice.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a> For the botanist, along the hedge banks, the blue
and slate-coloured soapwort is growing throughout the summer
and autumn, with purple cat-mint and wild clary. In the
waste places the thorn-apple shows its white blossoms; whilst
red stacks of fern and black turf ricks stand by every cottage
door to remind us how close we are to the Forest.</p>
<p>After we pass Bisterne,<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> the road becomes more interesting.
To our right rises the range of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hills, that is, the
fortified height, where remain the four mounds of the watch-towers
and the traces of the camp. Presently we come to Avon-Tyrrel
and the blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, built on the spot where Tiril&rsquo;s
horse is said to have been shod, and which pays a yearly fine of
three pounds and ten shillings to Government.</p>
<p>The actual Ford itself is some little way from the road.
Round it stretch meadows, with strong coarse grass and sedgy
weeds, branches of the Avon winding here and there, fringed by
willows, the main stream flowing out broad and strong, with
islands of osiers and rushes, where still breed wild duck and
teal, the whole backed by the gloom of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hills
crested by their darker pines. The old road, used now only by
the turf-cutters, crossing the former mill-brook, follows the bed of
one of the many streams, till, reaching the river at its widest
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
part, it bends across, gaining a lane on the opposite side, which
leads away past Ramsdown into Dorsetshire, and along which
tradition says the knight rode to Poole.</p>
<p>The next village we reach is Sopley, that is the <i>soc leag</i>, land
with the liberty of holding a court of <i>socmen</i>; just as the
neighbouring village is called Boghamton (<i>b&oacute;cland</i>), the village
of the charter-land, or, as we should now say, freehold. Its
interesting little cruciform church, Early-English and Perpendicular,
is dedicated to St. Michael. The Avon flows below,
and the old manor-house, now a mere cottage, stands in an
adjoining meadow. On the deep north porch rests the archangel,
on a corbel head. The fine old oak roof of the nave
was covered up some sixty or seventy years ago by a plastered
ceiling; but the corbel figures, playing the double pipe and
viol, are still standing. In the north aisle are the heads of
Edward III. and his queen. Two brackets for images project
from the window in the north transept, whose jambs, now
whitewashed over, were once painted with frescoes of the
mystical vine, in green and red. Here, in the north wall,
too, is an aumbrie, whilst the broken stone stairs to the rood-loft
still remain. In the south transept a hagioscope, now
walled up, looked into the chancel, where, on the floor, lie
two Early Decorated figures, formerly placed in tombs under
the rood-loft, and traditionally said to have been brought from
a church at Ripley. In the east window burns the fiery beacon
of the Comptons.</p>
<p>Here, too, the whole of the church has been most impartially,
and, I may add, successfully defaced. Everywhere has a
snowstorm of whitewash fallen. I know not why we in these
days should think that God delights in ugliness. Our forefathers
at least thought not so. It would be well if for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
moment we would consider how He adorns his own house, leads
the green arabesque of ivy over its walls, and brightens the
roof with the silver rays of mosses, and crowns each buttress
with the aureole of the lichen.</p>
<p>Leaving Sopley, we come to Winkton, the Weringetone of
<i>Domesday</i>, where stood two mills, which were rented, as we
have seen was often the case, by a payment of eels.</p>
<p>The views here are full of quiet beauty; the river winding
along between its green walls of rushes, set with white and
purple comfrey and yellow loosestrife, flowing into the darkness
of the trees, and then again coming out by meadows, across
which rises the Priory Church of Christchurch, standing out
clear and sharp against the dark mass of Hengistbury Head.</p>

</div>
<p>I have determined to give a chapter to Christchurch, not
because it contains more than many another town, but because
it is a fair representative of the generality of small English
boroughs. There is not a town in England, dating from even the
Middle Ages, which is not full of interest peculiarly its own, and
which does not possess memorials of the past which no other place
can show. It has been proposed, by a no mean authority, to
teach history by paintings and cartoons. But history is already
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
painted for us on our city walls, and written for us upon our
gates and crumbling castles. Our towns are in themselves
the best texts upon history. For what we have seen with
our eyes, and touched with our hands, leaves a more vivid
and more lasting impression than the closest study of libraries
of histories.</p>
<p>Further, the picture of a medi&aelig;val town, as given in its own
archives, with its own legislation, its peculiar manufacture, or
import, forms, to some extent, the true social picture of the
times. Its history reflects&mdash;and not faintly&mdash;the history of the
day. Christchurch was never a town of sufficient importance to
show all this in its municipal records. Yet, too, we shall see
that they in another way are, like the town itself, full of interest.
From a modern point of view there is nothing to be seen beyond
three or four straggling streets and its manufactory of fusee
watch-chains&mdash;the only one in England. All its interest and
associations lie with the past. The country round it, too, is
equally bound up with that same past. To the north rises
St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill, which we saw from the valley of the Avon,
with its oval and square camps, and rampart and double vallum,
crested with the mounds of its Roman watch-towers. The
river Stour winds along between rows of barrows. Hengistbury
Head is still fortified by its vast earthworks, and entrenched
by deep ditches from the Avon to the sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> Here the Britons
saw the first swarm of fugitive Belg&aelig; land and spread themselves
along the rich valleys of Dorsetshire.<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a> Here, centuries afterwards,
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
the West-Saxons watched the raven&mdash;standard of the
Danes scouring down the Channel, and knew their course along
the coast, at night, by the blaze of burning villages, and, in the
day, by the black trail of smoke.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></p>
<p>But to return to the town. Its Old-English names, Tweonea
and Twinham-burn, were given to it from its situation between
the rivers Avon and Stour. They were afterwards corrupted
into the Norman Thuinam; which was lost in the name of
its Priory, overshadowing the town with its magnificence.</p>
<p>Here, in 901, came &AElig;thelwald the &AElig;theling, son of &AElig;thered,
in his rebellion against his cousin Edward the Elder, and seized
the place. From Christchurch he fell back upon Wimborne, which
he fortified, exclaiming he would do one of two things, &ldquo;Either
there live, or there lie.&rdquo; That same night he fled to
Northumberland.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
<p>From <i>Domesday</i> we find that its manor was held in demesne
by the Conqueror, as also by Edward the Confessor, with a mill
renting for 5<i>s.</i>, whilst another, belonging to the Church, was
worth but 30<i>d.</i>, and that thirty-one tenements in the borough
paid a rent of 16<i>d.</i> Its woods, only, were inclosed in the
Forest.</p>
<p>The manor remained in the hands of the Crown till Henry I.
bestowed it on his friend and kinsman Richard de Redvers,
Earl of Devon, the ruins of whose castle still overlook the
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
Avon. Here his son Baldwin de Redvers in vain fortified himself
against Stephen. Here, too, lived his grandson William de
Vernon, who helped to bear the canopy at Richard&rsquo;s second
coronation at Winchester. Afterwards, the manor passed into
the hands of Isabella de Fortibus, who, on her death-bed, sold
it, with all her possessions, to Edward I., who well knew the
value of such a stronghold. Though Edward II. bestowed the
estate on Sir William Montacute, yet the castle still remained
in the hands of the Crown.</p>
<p>It was standing, though no longer a fortification, in the
Commonwealth period. Nothing, however, now remains but
the mere shell of the keep, whose walls are in places four yards
thick.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a></p>
<p>Below it stands what was, perhaps, the house of Baldwin
de Redvers, also in ruins, and roofless, but still a capital specimen
of what is so rarely seen, the true domestic architecture
of the twelfth century. Like all the other remaining houses of
this period, it is a simple oblong, seventy-one feet by twenty-four
broad, and only two stories high, placed for defence on a branch
of the Avon, which serves as a moat. On the south-east it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
flanked by a small attached tower, now in ruins, under which
the stream flows. The ground floor was divided in half by a
wall, whilst the outer walls, thicker on the east and south sides,
where more exposed to attacks than on the north and west, are
pierced with deeply-splayed loopholes looking out on the stream.
On this side was the hall, where lord, and guest, and serf, alike
ate and drank, and slept on the floor. The other western half
was divided into chambers and cellars, the kitchen probably
standing in the courtyard.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill33">
<img id="fig33" src="images/image133.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="578" />
<p class="pcap">The Norman House.</p>
</div>
<p>Above, approached by two stone staircases from within, and
not, as in most cases, from without, was the principal dwelling-room,
the solar, lighted on each side by three double lights,
carved on their outer arches with zig-zag and billet mouldings,
and on the south by a circular, and on the north by a fine
double window, once richly ornamented, but now nearly destroyed.
The fire-place, the only one in the house, is set nearly in the
centre of the east wall; and above it still stands, in the place of
the old smoke-vent, the beautiful round chimney, one of the
earliest in England, like the fire-place, hid in ivy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>There seems, however, as in the case of the still older
Norman house at Southampton, to have been no wall-passage
connecting the building, as we might have expected, with the
castle; but like it, its entrances, of which there were three,
one opening out upon the stream, were on the ground floor.<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a></p>
<p>Coming down to later times, the great Lord Clarendon here
possessed large property, and one of his favourite schemes was
to make the Avon navigable to Salisbury. For this purpose it
was surveyed by Yarranton, the hydrographer, who not only
reported favourably of the idea, but proposed to make the harbour
an anchorage for men-of-war, bringing forward the great natural
advantages of Hengistbury Head, as also the facilities of procuring
iron in the district, and wood from the New Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a>
All, however, fell to the ground with Clarendon&rsquo;s exile, and
the harbour is now silted up with sand and choked with weeds.</p>
<p>Nothing else is there to be mentioned, except the visit by
Edward VI. to the town, from whence he wrote a letter to
his friend Barnaby Fitz-Patrick, far superior to most royal
letters. The lazar-house, which stood in the Bargates, has long
since been destroyed. The old market-place has been lately
taken down; but in the main street, not far from the castle
keep, remains, lately-restored, one of those timbered houses
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
so common in the Midland counties and the Weald of Kent,
with their dormer windows and richly-carved bressumers and
barge-boards, but rarer in the West of England.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a> The glory,
however, of the town, the Priory Church, still stands. Before
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
describing it let us give some account of its history. Its earliest
buildings were founded by some of the secular canons of the
order of St. Augustine, probably on a spot used for worship by
the Romans.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a> Mention of it is made in <i>Domesday</i> as existing
in Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s reign, and as possessing five hydes
and one yardland in Thuinam, as also its tithes, and the third
of those of Holdenhurst.<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a> The present building, however, dates
only from the time of Flambard, who rebuilt the church, pulling
down the earlier building with its nine cells.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a> And in Henry I.&rsquo;s
reign, Baldwin de Redvers brought in the regular instead of the
secular canons, and placed them under the first prior, Reginald.</p>
<p>With this change new privileges and grants were made.
Riches flowed in on every side. Not only were the Redvers
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
benefactors, but the Courtenays, and Wests, and Salisburys, into
whose hands the manor of Christchurch came.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a></p>
<p>Like most other ecclesiastical buildings, we hear but little
of it till its dissolution. From its state we may be able to
judge of the general condition of the monasteries, and how
imperative was the change.</p>
<p>Leland<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> tells us that the Priory possessed but one volume&mdash;a
small work on the Old-English laws. Their own accounts
show us that the rules of St. Augustine had long been forgotten.
Drunkenness had taken the place of fasting; and instead of giving
they now owed.<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a> Tradition, too, adds that the brethren were
known in the town as the &ldquo;Priory Lubbers.&rdquo; To this had the
Austin Canons sank. So it was throughout England. Abbot
and poorest brother were alike steeped in sensuality, and benighted
in ignorance.</p>
<p>Of the last prior, John Draper, we catch some faint glimpse
in a letter from Robert Southwell and four other commissioners
to Cromwell, dated from Christchurch, the 2nd of December.
He appears to have been a man who trimmed his course with
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
the breath of authority, utterly selfish, utterly despicable. Not
one word does he appear to have raised on behalf of his priory.
Not one sigh did he utter for the old, nor one aspiration after
the new religion. Thus the commissioners write:&mdash;&ldquo;Our
humble dewties observyd unto y<sup>r</sup> gudde Lordeschippe. It
may lyke the same to be advertised that we have taken the
surrender of the late priorye of Christ Churche twynhm&#772;, wher
we founde the prior a very honest, conformable p&#772;son, And the
howse well furnysshede w<sup>t</sup> Jewellys and plate, whereof som be

ther be also other things of sylv&#772;, right honest and of gudde
valewe as well for the churche use as for the table resyvyd, and
kept to the Kings use.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a> Before the Dissolution came, whilst
matters still trembled in the balance&mdash;whilst still there was hope
that Protection would, for a little time longer, be given to hypocrisy,
and Authority to sloth, he pleaded with Henry.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a> Now, when
all hope was lost, when the end had arrived, the commissioners
compliment him as the &ldquo;very honest, conformable person.&rdquo;
Had he previously been in earnest they must have written very
differently. By his conformity he purchased his peace. And
so, after giving up his priory, he was allowed to depart with a
pension, to finish his life as he pleased, at the Prior&rsquo;s Lodgings
at Sumerford Grange. There he died; and was buried in front
of what had been his own choir; and his chantry still remains in
the south choir aisle. Of the conventual buildings, which stood
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
on the south side of the church, nothing remains except the
fragments of the outer wall and the entrance lodge, built by
Draper, with his initials still carved on the window label. A
modern house stands on the site of the Refectory; and in
digging its foundations, some tombs of the fourth century were
found.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> Other traces remain only in the names of the places,
as Paradise Walk, by the side of the mill stream, and the
Convent meadows, where, in an adjoining field, are the sites
of the fishponds of the brethren.</p>
<p>The church stands at the south-west of the town, on a rising
ground between the two rivers, its tower alike a seamark to the
ships and a landmark to the Valley. But the first thing which
strikes the visitor is not so much the tower, as the deep,
massive north porch, standing right out from the main building,
reaching to its roof, with its high-recessed arch, and its rich
doorways dimly seen, set between clusters of black Purbeck
marble pillars, and ornamented above with a quatrefoiled niche.</p>
<p>Standing here, and looking along the north aisle, the eye rests
on the Norman work of the transept, the low round arches interlacing
one another, their spandrels rich with billet and fishscale
mouldings; whilst beyond rises the Norman turret, banded with
its three string-courses, and enriched with its arcades, the space
between them netted over with coils of twisted cables.</p>
<p>This is true Norman work, such as you can see scarcely anywhere
else in England. And imagine what the church once
was&mdash;a massive lantern-tower springing up from the midst, the
crown of all this beauty.</p>
<p>Beyond all this lovely Romanesque work, rises the north
choir aisle, with its quatrefoiled parapet, whilst above gleam
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the traceried windows of the choir, with their flying buttresses;
and beyond them again stands the Lady Chapel, surmounted by
St. Michael&rsquo;s loft, ugly and vile.</p>
<p>Entering, and standing at the extreme south-west end, we
shall see the massive Norman piers rise in long lines, lightened
by their columns, and relieved by their capitals, the spaces
above each arch moulded with the tooth ornament. Above
springs the triforium with its double arches, some of their pillars
wreathed with foliage, the central shafts chequered in places
with network, and woven over with tracery. Above that again
runs the clerestory, now spoilt, whilst an open oak roof, hid by a
ceiling, but once rich with bosses and carved work, encloses all.</p>
<p>To go into details. The porch and north aisle are Early-English,
whilst a Norman arcade runs the whole length of the
south aisle. The tower, and choir, and Lady Chapel, are Perpendicular,
and the nave, as far as the clerestory windows,
Norman.</p>
<p>Passing through the rich rood-screen, which, however, sadly
blocks up the way, we reach the choir, with its four traceried
windows on either side, and clustered columns, from which
springs its groined roof with bosses of foliage and pendants
bright with gold, whilst the capitals of the shafts and the
quatrefoils of the archivolts are rich with colour. The stalls
are carved with grotesque heads and figures, like those in the
Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity, at Stratford-upon-Avon.
Before us now stands the lovely reredos, illustrating the words
of Isaiah,&mdash;&ldquo;There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of
Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.&rdquo; Jesse sleeps
at the bottom, his hand supporting his head, whilst David, with
his fingers on his harp-strings, and Solomon, sit on each side,
the vine spreading upwards, bearing its leaf and full fruit in
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
Mary, to whose Son the Wise Men are offering their presents.
Such is the screen, and had the execution been equal to the
design, it would have been the finest in England. The carving
seems, however, never to have been finished, and certainly in
parts only to have been roughly cut by some inferior hand, and
never to have received the last touches of the master-artist.
Even now, in its present condition, it stands before those of
Winchester and St. Alban&rsquo;s, inferior only to that of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Overie.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></p>
<p>Passing on we come to the Lady Chapel, with its traceried
roof. Under the east window are the remnants of another rich
screen. The high altar, too, with its slab of Purbeck marble
cut with five crosses, remains, whilst two recessed altar tombs
to Sir Thomas West and his mother stand in the north and
south walls.</p>
<p>But what we should especially see, both for its beauty and
its interest, is the Chantry Chapel, built for her last resting-place
by Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, mother of Cardinal
Pole. It stands in the north choir aisle, its roof rich with
arabesque tracery and carved bosses, telling a curious story in
our English history. Attainted of treason the Countess was
confined two years in the Tower before she suffered. When the
day of execution came, she walked out on the fatal Tower Green;
and still firm&mdash;still to the last resolute&mdash;refused to lay her head
on the block. &ldquo;So should traitors do,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
none;&rdquo; and the headsman was obliged to butcher her as best he
could.<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a></p>
<p>In the same letter before quoted from the Commissioners for
the Suppression of Monasteries, dated from Christchurch, occurs
this passage:&mdash;&ldquo;In thys churche we founde a chaple and monum&#275;t
curiosly made of cane [Caen] stone &#772;paryd by the late
mother of Raynolde pole for herre buriall, wiche we have causyd
to be defacyd, and all the armys and badgis clerly to be delete.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a>
To this day the vengeance of Henry&rsquo;s commissioners is visible,
her arms being broken, and the bosses defaced, though her
motto, &ldquo;<i>Spes mea in Deo est</i>,&rdquo; can still be read.</p>
<p>At the end of this aisle, under the east window, lie the
alabaster effigies of Sir John Chydioke and his wife. The
knight, who fell in the wars of York and Lancaster, wears
his coat of mail, his head resting on his helmet, and his hands
clasped together in prayer. At the western end, adjoining the
north transept, stand two oratories with groined roofs, enriched
with foliated bosses, whilst the capitals, from which the arches
spring, are carved with heads.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a></p>
<p>In the south choir aisle stand more monuments, amongst
them the mortuary chapel of Robert Harys, with his rebus
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
sculptured on a shield; and the chapel of Draper, the last
prior, noticeable for its rich canopied niche over the doorway.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a></p>
<p>And now that the reader has seen each part, let him go
back to the west end, and sweep out of sight the whole thicket
of pews, and break down the rood-screen blocking up the
view, and looking through and beyond it, past the long line
of Norman bays, with their sculptured tables, and past the
chancel, imagine the stone reredos, as it once was, shining
with gold and colour, all its niches filled with statues, and the
windows above blazing with crimson and purple, through which
the sunlight poured, staining the carved stalls and misereres,&mdash;and
then he will have some faint idea of the former glory
of the church.<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a></p>
<p>Most interesting is it, too, from another point of view.
Since the Austin canons were more especially concerned with
man&rsquo;s struggle in daily life, their churches assumed a parochial
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
character. Hence we here have the spacious nave, so different
to that of the old Nunnery Church of Romsey, the west tower
and doorway&mdash;absent at Romsey&mdash;and the lovely north porch
looking out to the town.</p>
<p>The whole building, I am sorry to add, is sadly out of
repair. Restoration has been going on for some time past; but
here, as in all similar cases, money is much needed. Surely
men might give something, if from no higher motive than of
keeping up a memorial of the piety of a past age. We inveigh
against Cromwell and the Puritans&mdash;against the sacrilege of
horses stabled in the choir, and the stalls turned into mangers;&mdash;against
the sword which struck down the sculptured images,
and the fire which consumed the carved woodwork. But the
harm which the Puritans wrought is little compared with ours,
in allowing the loveliness of our churches to rot by our negligence,
and their sacredness to perish by our apathy.</p>

<p>Little has been seen of the sea, except from Calshot Castle
to Leap. Though, too, the sea-coast here, as there, is no
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
longer in the Forest, yet if we miss this walk we shall lose
some of the most beautiful scenery in the district.</p>
<p>As we leave Christchurch by the Lymington Road, Mudeford
lies on the right, and Burton, with its Staple Cross, on the left.
Few things are more touching than these old grey relics of the
past, standing solitary in our cross-roads, the dial united with
the Cross, to show both how short was man&rsquo;s life, and where
lay his only salvation. But we now profane them, and turn
them, as here, into direction posts, or break them up, as at
Burgate, to mend the road.</p>
<p>Both villages will some day be more sought after than at
present, for at Burton lived Southey, with his friend Charles
Lloyd, and sang the praises of the valley in better verse than
usual. At Mudeford, Stewart Rose, the author of <i>The Red
King</i>, built Gundimore, where, in 1807, Scott stayed, writing
<i>Marmion</i>, and riding over the Forest exploring the barrows.
In the same village Coleridge lodged during the winter of
1816.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>A little way along the main road lies Somerford, once one
of the Granges of Christchurch Priory. Its barns and stables
are partly built from the prior&rsquo;s lodgings, whose site may here
and there be faintly traced; and the chapel, which in Grose&rsquo;s
time was still standing, with the initials of the last prior, John
Draper, cut on the window labels.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a></p>
<p>The best plan, however, is not to go along the road, but the
shore as far as Chewton Glen, and there climb up the cliff. The
sands are white and hard, strewed with fragments of iron-stone,
and large <i>septaria</i>, from which cement is made, and for which,
farther on, a fleet of sloops is dredging a little way from the
shore. In the far distance gleam the white and black and orange-coloured
bands of sand and clay scoring the Barton cliffs.<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a></p>
<p>The glen, or &ldquo;bunny,&rdquo; as it is locally called, runs right
down into the sea; the high tide rushing up it, and driving back
its Forest stream. Down to the very edge it is fringed with
low oak copses, covered in the spring, as far as high-tide mark,
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
with blue bells, and
strewed with yellow tufts
of primroses. In the
summer, too, the ground
is as deep a green with
ferns as the oak leaves
above; whilst the stream
flows between banks bordered
with blue skull-cap
and purple helleborine.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="map1">

<p>Then, as you climb
up to the down, on the
opposite side, stretches a
view, hard to be matched
in England either for
extent or beauty. On
one side rolls the English
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
Channel, indenting the shore with its deep bay as far as
the land-locked harbour of Christchurch, shut in by Hengistbury
Head and the white Swanage rocks; and, on the other,
it sweeps away by the long beach of Hurst and its round gray
castle. Opposite, glitter the coloured sands and chalk cliffs
of Alum Bay, and the white Needle Rocks running wedge-shaped
into the sea. Farther eastward, rise the treeless downs,
and the breach opens across the Island to Freshwater Gate,
and the two batteries, built into the cliff, one by one appear:
the long scene ended at last by the houses of Yarmouth&mdash;the
Solent still winding onward, like some great river.</p>
<p>An uninterrupted path runs, for some three or four miles,
along the top of the cliff&mdash;the scene constantly changing in its
beauty. Below hangs a broken under-cliff, shelving down to the
sea, strewed here and there with blocks of gravel, the grass and
furze growing on them just as they fell. On the shore stretch
long reaches of yellow sand, separated by narrow strips of
pebbles, and patches of dark green Barton clay, embossed with
shells, and studded with sharks&rsquo; teeth.</p>
<p>Passing the Coastguard Station and the Gangway, we reach
Becton Bunny&mdash;very different to Chewton, but equally lovely,
with its bare wide gorge, and its beds of furze and heath fringing
the edge of the cliff.<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> Very beautiful, too, are the summer sunsets
seen from this point&mdash;the sun sinking far down the channel,
lighting up the coloured sands of Alum Bay purple and gold,
tinting the white chalk cliffs with rose and vermilion, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
crimson of the sky floating on the waves as they break along
the shore.</p>
<p>Still following the path along the top of the cliff, we pass the
grave-yard, where stood the old cruciform church of Hordle&mdash;once
in the middle of the village, but now only a hundred yards
from the sea. Nothing of it remains except some blocks of
Grey Wethers, used for its foundation, and too large to be
removed. Very interesting are these stones, brought up from
the shore, where, now and then, one or two may be seen at low
tide, tumbled from the drift above&mdash;the same stones as those at
Stonehenge, left on the top of the chalk. Gone, too, are its
mill and its six salterns, mentioned in <i>Domesday</i>, and the village
itself removed inland. The sailors, however, dredging for
cement-stone or for fish, sometimes draw up great logs of wood,
locally known as &ldquo;mootes,&rdquo; which may perhaps tell of the
salterns, or the time when the Forest stretched to the sea. The
salterns of the Normans and the Old-English have suffered very
different fates. In Normandy the sea no longer reaches to their
sites,<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> whilst here it has long since rolled over them.</p>
<p>Beyond this again is Mineway, reminding us, by its name,
of the time when the iron-stone was collected on the shore and
taken to the Sowley furnaces to be smelted.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a> Farther on, down
in the valley made by the stream, which turns the village mill,
mentioned in <i>Domesday</i>, lies Milford. The church spire rises
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
up prettily amongst its trees, and the church itself is a good
example of our village churches, built in three or four different
styles. The tower is Early-English, surmounted by a string-course
of Norman heads. In the north side stands a curious
inserted doorway, with trefoil heading, whilst two Norman
arches remain in the nave joined by Early-English, springing
from black Purbeck marble shafts.</p>
<p>To the south stretches the long Hurst beach, formed, in
much the same way as the more famous Chesil Bank, of
the rolled pebbles brought up from the Barton Cliffs by the
strong tides aided with the westerly gales, making a breakwater
to the whole of the Solent. Now and then close to it appear the
floating islands, known as the Shingles, sometimes rising for
only a few hours above the sea, and at others remaining long
enough to become green with bladderwort and samphire.</p>
<p>Across to the Isle of Wight, at the narrowest point, it is only
a mile; and so fast does the Solent tide,<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a>
when once the ebb is
felt, pour itself along the narrow gorge, that it fills up Christchurch
Bay, higher than at the flood, thus making, in fact,
a double high-water. At the extreme end stands Hurst Castle,
built by Henry VIII., from the ruins of Beaulieu Abbey.
Whatever opinion we may have of Henry&rsquo;s private character,
there can be but one as to his foresight and energy in defending
the country. Much for this may be forgiven. Hall wrote in no
exaggerated strain when he said:&mdash;&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s highness never
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
ceases to study and take pains both for the advancement of
the commonwealth of this his realm of England, and for the
defence of the same.... Wherefore, his Majesty in his
own personne took very laborious and painful journeys towards
the sea-coasts. Also, he sent dyvers of his nobles and counsellors
to view and search all the portes and dangers in the
coastes, ... and in all soche doubtful places his Highness
caused dyvers and many bulwarks and fortifications to be made.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a>
And of them, Hurst Castle, like Calshot, which we have seen,
was one, and still stands, additionally fortified by guns, and
guarded by the far better defences of lighthouses, and beacons,
and telegraph stations.<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a></p>
<p>Here it was, on the 1st December, 1642, Charles I. was
brought, after holding his mock court at Newport, by Colonel
Cobbit, who had seized him in the name of the army. Here,
too, he still showed all the foolish childishness which Laud had
taught him, putting faith in the omen of his candle burning
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
brightly or dimly,<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a> which detracts so much from any interest
we might otherwise feel for him in his days of care and sorrow.
A closet is shown where he is said to have been confined, and
where his Golden Rules are said to have hung; but from Herbert&rsquo;s
memoirs, evidently neither the room where he lived or slept.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a>
Herbert&rsquo;s account of Hurst is so graphic that I give it nearly in
full:&mdash;&ldquo;The wind and tide favouring, the King and his attendants
crossed the narrow sea in three hours,<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> and landed at
Hurst Castle, or Block House rather, erected by order of King
Henry VIII., upon a spot of earth a good way into the sea,
and joined to the firm land by a narrow neck of sand, which is
covered over with small loose stones and pebbles; and upon both
sides the sea beats, so as at spring tides and stormy weather the
land passage is formidable and hazardous. The castle has very
thick stone walls, and the platforms are regular, and both have
several culverines and sakers mounted.... The captain
of this wretched place was not unsuitable; for, at the King&rsquo;s
going ashore, he stood ready to receive him with small observance.
His look was stern. His hair and large beard were black and
bushy. He held a partizan in his hand; and, Switz-like, had
a great basket-hilt sword on his side. Hardly could one see a
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
man of more grim aspect, and no less robust and rude was his
behaviour.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> The account is very life-like, though some allowance
must be made for Herbert&rsquo;s prejudices against this gaunt
Puritan captain, who, we learn, by-and-by became more civil.
Colonel Cobbit, in whose charge the King was, seems to
have treated him with uniform respect and kindness. Charles
stayed here six-and-twenty days, walking along the beach,
watching the ships passing up and down the Solent, and receiving
the cavaliers of Hampshire, who came for the last time
to pay their respects. Then, at last, he was suddenly taken
away to show at Whitehall a better courage and wisdom in
death than in life.</p>
<p>About three miles from Milford, on the mouth of the Boldre
Water, lies the port of Lymington, the Mark of the Limingas, as
the neighbouring hamlet of Pennington is that of the Penningas.<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a>
Its manor, like that of Christchurch, once belonged to
Isabella de Fortibus, and was given, with some other possessions,
by Edward I., to her rightful heir, the Earl of Devon, whose
arms are still quartered with those of the Corporation. It
is another of those towns, which, like Christchurch, though in a
very different way, is associated with the past. It has no
monastic buildings, no ruins of any kind, no church worth even
a glance. Yet, too, it can tell of departed greatness.</p>
<p>From the coins which have been dug up in the town, and the
camp at Buckland Rings,<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> it was evidently well known to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
Romans. In <i>Domesday</i>, the famous Roger de Yvery held one
hyde here; but its woods were thrown into the Forest, and
for this reason the manor was only rated at one half. No
mention is made of its salt-works, though we know, from a grant
of Richard de Redvers, in 1147, confirming his father&rsquo;s bequest
of the tithe of them to Quarr Abbey, that they were then
probably in existence.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> Larger than Portsmouth, in 1345,
it contributed nearly double the number of ships and men
to Edward III.&rsquo;s fleet for the invasion of France. We must
not, however, conclude that it has decreased.<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a> Larger now than
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
ever, like so many other old towns, it has not increased in a relative
proportion with younger rivals favoured by the accidents of
position or commerce. Like, too, all other similar ports, it has
its tales to tell of French invasions, and, like similar boroughs,
of the Civil War; but they are merely traditional, and, therefore,
vague and unsatisfactory. Loyal from first to last, it is said to
have at its own cost supplied with provisions the ships of Prince
Charles, when he lay in the Yarmouth Roads, hoping to rescue
his father from Carisbrook. In still later times, carried away
by Protestant sympathies, it espoused the cause of the imbecile
Monmouth, the mayor raising some hundred men to join his
standard.<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a></p>
<p>Most of the places round Lymington, Buckland Rings,
Boldre Church, Sway Common, with its barrows, we have
already seen. A little, though, to the eastward, at Baddesley,
near Sowley Pond, formerly stood a Preceptory of the Knights
Templar, and afterwards of those of St. John of Jerusalem. At
the Dissolution it was granted to Sir Thomas Seymour, and
again by Edward VI. to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, but subsequently,
under Mary, restored to the Hospitallers. Nothing of
it is now left.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a></p>
<p>Here, then, at Lymington, we have been the whole circumference
of the Forest. I do not know that I have omitted
anything of real interest. Mere idle gossip, vague stories, I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
left to those who care to write, and those who like to read such
things. The geology, and botany, and folk-lore of the district,
to which it was impossible to do more than to make general references,
will be found in the succeeding chapters. As was before
said, in the wild commons and woods themselves I have myself
taken the greatest interest, and wished to impress their beauty
on the reader, feeling that a love for Nature is the mainspring
of all that is noble in life, and all that is precious in Art. I do
not know either that I have anywhere exaggerated. On the
contrary, no words can paint, much more exaggerate, the loveliness
of the woods. And of all walks in the district, this over
the Hordle and Barton Cliffs is by no means the least beautiful,
though no longer in the Forest.</p>

<p>Many people have a vague notion that the gipsies constitute

whereas, of course, they are mere cyphers. An amusing enough

French author, in a work upon England, has devoted a special
chapter to the New Forest, and there paid more attention to the
gipsies than any one else, and entirely forgets the West-Saxon,
whose impress is indelibly marked, not only in the language, but
in the names of every town, village, and field.</p>
<p>As, however, every one takes a romantic interest in these
nomads, we must not entirely pass over them. Here and there
still linger a few in whose veins run Indian blood, against whom
Henry VIII. made bad laws, and Skelton worse rhymes. The
principal tribes round Lyndhurst are the Stanleys, the Lees, and
Burtons; and near Fordingbridge, the Snells. They live chiefly
in the various droves and rides of the Forest, driven from place
to place by the policeman, for to this complexion have things
come. One of their favourite halting-places is amongst the low
woods near Wootton, where a dozen or more brown tents are
always fluttering in the wind, and as the night comes on the
camp-fires redden the dark fir-stems.</p>
<p>The kingly title formerly held by the Stanleys is now in the
possession of the Lees. They all still, to a certain extent, keep
up their old dignity, and must by no means be confounded with
the strolling outcasts and itinerant beggars who also dwell in the
Forest. Their marriages, too, are still observed with strictness,
and any man or woman who marries out of the caste, as recently
in the case of one of the Lees, who wedded a blacksmith, is
instantly disowned. The proverb, too, of honour among thieves
is also still kept, and formal meetings are every now and then
convened to expel any member who is guilty of cheating his
kinsman.</p>
<p>Since the deer have been destroyed in the Forest, life is not
to them what it was. They are now content to live upon a stray
fowl, or hedgehog, or squirrel, baked whole in a coat of clay,
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
and to gain a livelihood by weaving the heather into mats, and
brooms, and beehives.</p>
<p>They are, however, mere wanderers, and have nothing to do
with the soil. It is with the West-Saxon that we are most
concerned. And in the New Forest he will be found just such
another man as his forefather in the days of William the Red,
putting the same faith in visions and omens which made the
King exclaim, on the morning of his death, upon the news of
the monk of Gloucester&rsquo;s dream, &ldquo;Do you take me for an
Englishman?&rdquo; believing firmly in groaning ash-trees, and oaks
which bud on Christmas-eve, and witches who can turn themselves
into hares, and that the marl which he digs is still red
with the blood of his ancient foes the Danes.<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a></p>
<p>Here, as we have seen in Hampshire, at Calshot, on the
borders of the Forest, Cerdic landed. Here he defeated the
Britons, and established the kingdom of the West-Saxons.
Here the West-Saxon Alfred rallied his countrymen and
crowned defeat with victory. Here, too, stood the capital of
Wessex, Winchester, in whose cathedral lie the old West-Saxon
kings. Here, then, if anywhere, we should expect to
find West-Saxon characteristics and a West-Saxon population.</p>
<p>As is well known, after the battle of Hastings, the West-Saxons,
with one or two exceptions, succumbed willingly enough
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
to the Conqueror, who lived amongst them; whilst the Northmen
across the Humber bid him defiance. Every one must
to this day notice the extreme deference, almost amounting to
a painful obsequiousness, of the lower classes in the southern,
compared with their independent manner in the northern, parts
of England. We find, too, mingled, however, with characteristics
from other sources, the West-Saxon element not only in the
appearance of the long-limbed Forest peasantry, with their
narrow head and shoulders, and loose, shambling gait, but also
in their slowness of perception. They betray, too, to this hour
that worst Teutonic trait of fatalism, observable in all their
epitaphs, and in their daily expression, &ldquo;It was not to be,&rdquo;
applied to anything which does not take place. Notwithstanding,
too, their apparent servility, an amount of cunningness
and craft peeps out, which in a different age compelled
the Conqueror to make special laws against assassination.<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a></p>
<p>Much must be set against these drawbacks. Enslaved to
an extent which no modern historian has dared to reveal, and
can only be fully conceived by the dreadful story of <i>The Chronicle</i>,&mdash;treated
as beasts rather than even slaves,&mdash;the West-Saxons
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
showed, under the Normans, a spirit of obedience and an adaptability
to changed circumstances which are above praise. Let us
give the West-Saxon labourer credit for it both then and to this
day, that though the most ill-paid and ill-fed in England, he
bears his heavy yoke of poverty without a murmur.</p>
<p>Turning to another side of his character, we find him loving
the same old sports as in the days of Alfred. He still follows
the hounds on foot, and when there were deer in the Forest,
naturally killed them. Wrestling and cudgel-playing have been
continued till the last few years close to the northern boundaries
of the Forest. The old Hock-tide games were till a late period
kept up in the northern parts, and &ldquo;Hock-tide money&rdquo; was not
so very long ago paid as an acknowledgment for certain Forest
privileges. Heartiness and roughness still go hand in hand with
him as with his forefathers. But a heaviness of intellect is
always visible, and, as with all his race, a sadness oppresses
his mirth. His dress to this day, too, bespeaks his nationality.
He still wears what is locally called the &ldquo;smicket,&rdquo; and
sometimes the &ldquo;surplice,&rdquo; the Old-English <i>smoc</i>, named also
the <i>tunece</i>. It is still, too, as formerly, tied round the waist
with a leathern band. His legs are still cased, as we see
the Old-English in their drawings, with gaiters, known as
&ldquo;vamplets,&rdquo; or &ldquo;strogs,&rdquo; equivalent to the &ldquo;cockers&rdquo; of the
Midland Counties, which do not reach quite so high as the former,
and &ldquo;mokins,&rdquo; which are merely made of coarse sacking.</p>
<p>And now let us see how far he has made his presence felt
on the district and in the language. But we must beware of
overstraining our theory. No portion of our history is, in its
details, so difficult as the English Conquest. None, to any
statement which may be made, requires so many qualifications.
The first faint flow of the Teutonic immigration was felt long
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
prior to C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s invasion&mdash;centuries before the main wave burst
over the country. We must, too, carefully bear in mind that in
Wessex, more than in any other part, the conquerors and conquered
were blended together.<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a> They mixed, however, everywhere
far more than is commonly allowed. Our language bears
testimony to the general fact. The many Keltic household
words in daily use are the best evidence.</p>
<p>Here in the New Forest I may mention that the form
&ldquo;plock&rdquo; is used instead of the common block (<i>bloc</i>), and that we
have, as, perhaps, throughout the West of England, &ldquo;hob,&rdquo; in
the sense of potato-hob&mdash;a place where potatoes are covered
over, instead of &ldquo;hog&rdquo; (<i>hwg</i>), noticed by Mr. Davies in his
list of Keltic words in Lancashire. Further, we find the terms
&ldquo;more&rdquo; (<i>maur</i>), for a root, &ldquo;mulloch,&rdquo; for dirt, and &ldquo;bower-stone,&rdquo;
for a boundary-stone.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a> Here, too, as in other places,
the Britons have left the traces of their rule on the broader
natural features of the country&mdash;on the rivers, as the Exe
(<i>y</i> [<i>g</i>] <i>wysg</i>, the current), and Avon (<i>Afon</i>, the river), and Avon
Water, near Setthorns, and Boldre (<i>y Byldwr</i>, the full stream),
and Stour ([<i>G</i>]<i>wys-dwr</i>, the deep water), and in the district
itself, in the now almost forgotten name of Ytene. We find
their influence, too, perhaps, in such local names of villages
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
and fields as Penerley, Denny, Fritham, Cocketts, Cammel
Green, and Flasket&rsquo;s Lane. As might be expected, the traces
of the Danes are very much less; and I hardly like even to
venture on the conjecture that the various &ldquo;Nashes&rdquo; along
the coast are corruptions of <i>n&aelig;s</i>. Here, in the Forest, we
have no Danish &ldquo;thorpes&rdquo; or &ldquo;bys.&rdquo; There are no Carlbys,
as in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, but plenty of Old-English
Charltons, and Charlmoors, and Charlmeads. No Norse &ldquo;forces&rdquo;
run here, as in the north of England, but only &ldquo;rides.&rdquo; No
&ldquo;denes&rdquo; open out to the sea, as in Durham, but only &ldquo;chines&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bunnies.&rdquo; No Jutish &ldquo;ings&rdquo; are dwelt in, as in Kent,
but only &ldquo;tons&rdquo; and &ldquo;leys.&rdquo; Here, in fact, the people of
Cerdic have identified themselves with the land, and have left
their impress, now unchanged for more than thirteen centuries,
on all the towns, and hamlets, and homesteads.</p>
<p>Thus we find on the eastern side of the Forest, formerly in
it, Eling, the Mark of the Ealingas, Totton, the Mark of the
Totingas; on the south, Lymington and Pennington, the Marks
of the Limingas and Penningas; and on the west, Fordingbridge,
the Mark of the Fordingas, and Ellingham, that is,
Adeling&rsquo;s Hamlet, Adelingeham, in <i>Domesday</i>, where some of
the neighbouring woods are to this hour called Adlem&rsquo;s
Plantations.</p>
<p>We will not press, as a proof of descent, the number of
Old-English surnames, which may easily be collected in the
district. We must remember that they were not used, in our
modern sense, till long after the Norman Conquest; and when
adopted, people were more likely to choose them from English,
than from Norman or other sources. Such evidence establishes
nothing.</p>
<p>In other ways, however, do we find the Old-English nomenclature
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
telling us the history of the people and the country;&mdash;in
Hengistbury Head, on the south-west, reminding us of the
white horse&mdash;the Hengest of the High-German,<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a> and Calshot
at the east, spelt as we know in Edward I.&rsquo;s time, Kalkesore;
on the north-west in Charford&mdash;the old Cerdices-ford of <i>The
Chronicle</i>; on the south in Darrat (Danes-rout) and Danestream,
whose waters, the peasant maintains, still run red with
the blood of the conquered.</p>
<p>Everywhere we meet similar compounds,&mdash;in Needsore,
which the Ordnance map spells Needs-oar, and thus loses the
etymology, which, like the Needle Rocks, means simply the under
(German <i>nieder</i>) shore; in the various Galley Hills, corrupted
into Gallows Hills, which have nothing to do with the later, but
the older instrument, which contained the signal-fires, and are
connected with the words &ldquo;galley,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> to frighten, and &ldquo;galley-baggar,&rdquo;
a scarecrow, both still heard every day, from the Old-English
<i>g&aelig;lan</i>.</p>
<p>We find the same impress in Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst,
Ashurst, and, as we have before said, in various other hursts,<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a> in
the different Holmsleys, Netleys,<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a> Beckleys, Bentleys, Bratleys,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
Stockleys, all from the Old-English <i>leag</i>; in the various <i>tons</i>, as
Wootton, Winkton, Everton, Burton, and Hinton; in Gore and
Goreley, the muddy places; in Culverley, the dove lea; in the
Roydons and Rowdouns, the rough places; in Rhinefield, the
brook field; and in Brockis Hill, the badger&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p>Take only the very names of the fields and we shall meet the
same element, as in the Wareham field, the fishing place field;
Conygers and Coneygar,<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a> the King&rsquo;s ground, to be met in
every village; in the linches, as Goreley Linch, that is, Goreley
Headland, or literally, the dirty-field headland; in Hangerley,
the corner meadow; Hayes, the enclosure, with all its compounds,
as Westhayes, Powelhayes, Crithayes, and Felthayes;
in such terms as Withy Eyot, that is, Withy Island; and the
different Rodfords&mdash;&ldquo;hry&eth;eranford&rdquo;&mdash;the cattleford, the Old-English
equivalent to the Norman Bovreford.</p>
<p>We meet, too, in daily life, such words as hayward for the
North-Country &ldquo;pinder;&rdquo; barton, literally the barley place, instead
of the Keltic &ldquo;crooyard;&rdquo;&mdash;the same Old-English element
in the names of the flowers, as bishop-wort (<i>bisceop-wyrt</i>), one of
the mints, from which the peasant makes his &ldquo;hum-water;&rdquo;
cassock (from <i>cassuc</i>), any kind of binding weed, and cammock
(from <i>cammec</i>), any of the St. John&rsquo;s worts, or ragworts; clivers
(from <i>clife</i>, a bur), the heriff; and wythwind, by which name
the convolvulus is still known, the Old-English &ldquo;wi&eth;-winde.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>These words, however, belong more especially to the next
chapter. To descend from generals to particulars, let us notice
some of the verbal characteristics by which a West-Saxon population
may be distinguished. As a rule it may be laid down
that the West-Saxons give a soft, and the Anglians and Northmen
a hard sound to all their words. Thus in the New Forest
we find the West-Saxons saying burrow for barrow; haish for
harsh; pleu for plough; heth for heath, instead of the &ldquo;hawth&rdquo;
of the Eastern rapes of Sussex; mash for marsh; Gerge for
George; slue for sloe, and again, for slough, the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; of the
north; bin for been, and also being; justle for jostle, as in
Nahum, ch. ii. v. 4; athert for athwart; wool for hole; ballat
for ballad, or, as it is pronounced in the more northern counties,
ballard; ell for eel; clot and clit for clod; stiffle for stifle; ruff
for roof, and so on. Thus, too, we meet here not with Deepdene,
but Dibden, spelt in Boazio&rsquo;s map of 1591, Debden. No
Chawton, but only Chewton occurs, no Farnham, but only
Fernham and Fernhill.</p>
<p>The West-Saxons, too, have a peculiar drawl. So in the
New Forest we may hear them saying pearts for parts; stwoane
for stone; twereable for terrible; measter (<i>m&aelig;ster</i>), instead of
the Anglian &ldquo;muster;&rdquo; and yees instead of the Sussex &ldquo;yus.&rdquo;
As others have also remarked, the West-Saxon substitutes <i>a</i>
for <i>o</i>. So here we get lard for lord; nat for not; amang for
among; knap for knop; shart for short; starm for storm; and
Narmanton for Normanton. Not only this, but the West-Saxon
in the New Forest substitutes <i>a</i> for <i>e</i>, as in agg for egg, and lag
for leg. He not only retains the hard <i>g</i>, but gives a <i>k</i> when
he can, as in kiver for cover, and aker for acorn, the &ldquo;aitchorn&rdquo;
of the Anglian districts. Let us notice, too, that he always
changes the <i>f</i> into a <i>v</i>, as vern for fern, vire for fire, evvets
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
for effets, voam for foam, as written by Chaucer, vall for fall,
and fitches for vetches, as we find it in Ezekiel, ch. iv. v. 9.</p>
<p>To go further into these distinctions is here impossible. As
are the people so is the language. By an analysis of the
published glossaries of Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, and Sussex, I find
that the New Forest possesses above two-thirds of the two
former, differing here and there only in pronunciation, whilst of
the latter it scarcely possesses one-tenth, proving plainly that the
people are West-Saxons rather than South, descendants of
Cerdic more than of Ella.<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a></p>
<p>Turning from these minor characteristics, and looking at
the people themselves as they once were, and as they now stand,
much might be added as to the unequal race which the West-Saxon
has run with the Anglian and the Northman, and its
effect on his character. The most casual observer even, in going
over so small a space as the New Forest, must have noticed how
Nature has favoured the Northern and Midland counties in their
sources of wealth and industry. The great home-trade of
the Middle Ages has entirely deserted the South. Once, too,
all our men-of-war sailed from what are now small ports on
the south coast. Our fleets were manned by crews from the
Isle of Wight, and Lymington, and Lyme, and the neighbouring
harbours. The seamanship of the West-Country was England&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
right arm.<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a> But now the iron fields of Staffordshire have
put out the furnaces. The coal mines of Durham have destroyed
the charcoal trade, and taken away the seamanship.
The brine-pits of Cheshire have dried up the salterns which
covered the south-western shores. Of course, this loss of
material prosperity has told on the intelligence and morals of
the district.</p>
<p>In the New Forest itself, till within the last thirty years,
smuggling was a recognized calling. Lawlessness was the rule
during the last century. Warner says that he had then seen
twenty or thirty waggons laden with kegs, guarded by two
or three hundred horsemen, each bearing two or three &ldquo;tubs,&rdquo;
coming over Hengistbury Head, making their way, in the open
day, past Christchurch to the Forest. At Lymington, a troop
of bandits took possession of the well-known Ambrose Cave, on
the borders of the Forest, and carried on, not only smuggling,
but wholesale burglary. The whole country was plundered.
The soldiers were at last called out, the men tracked, and
the cave entered. Booty to an enormous extent was found.
The captain turned King&rsquo;s evidence, and confessed that he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
murdered upwards of thirty people, whose bodies had been
thrown down a well, where they were found.<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a></p>
<p>Such was the state of the New Forest in the last century.
But as recently as thirty or forty years ago every labourer was
either a poacher or a smuggler, very often a combination of the
two. Boats were built from the Forest timber in many a barn;
and to this day various fields far inland are still called &ldquo;the dock-yard
mead.&rdquo; Crews of Foresters, armed with &ldquo;swingels,&rdquo; such
as the West-Saxons of Somerset fought with in the battle of
Sedgemoor, defied the coastguard. The principal &ldquo;runs&rdquo; were
made at Beckton and Chewton Bunnies, and the Gangway.
Often as many as a hundred &ldquo;tubs,&rdquo; each containing four
gallons, and worth two or three guineas, or even more, would
be run in a night. Each man would carry two or three of
these kegs, one slung in front and two behind; or if the cliff
was very steep, a chain of men was formed, and the tubs passed
from hand to hand.</p>
<p>All this has been done within the memory of people not so
very old. Men were killed at Milton. Old Becton Bunny
House was burnt to the ground. A keg was carelessly broached,
and the spirit caught fire from the spark of a pipe. Every
person was in fact engaged in smuggling:&mdash;some for profit,
many merely from a love of adventure. Everywhere was understood
the smuggler&rsquo;s local proverb, &ldquo;Keystone under the hearth,
keystone under the horse&rsquo;s belly.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Now nothing either in smuggling or poaching is to any
extent attempted. In the one case the crime is unprofitable, in
the other the temptation is withdrawn. Labour, too, is more
plentiful, and the Government works of draining and planting in
the Forest employ most of the Foresters.</p>
<p>Many a man, however, can still tell how he has baited a
hook, tied to a bough, with apples to snare the deer; how he
has pared the faun&rsquo;s hoof to keep the doe in one place, till he
wanted to kill her. But now the deer are all gone, except a few,
only seen now and then, wandering about in the wildest and
loneliest parts. As to re-stocking the Forest, we can only say,
with good Bishop Hoadley, respecting Waltham Chace,&mdash;&ldquo;the
deer have already done enough mischief.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Intimately bound up with the race are of course the folk-lore
of a district, and what we are now pleased to call provincialisms,
but which are more properly nationalisms, showing us the real
texture of our language; and in every way preferable to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
Latin and Greek hybridisms, which are daily coined to suit the
exigencies of commerce or science.</p>
<p>Provincialisms are, in fact, when properly looked at, not so
much portions of the original foundations of a language, as
the very quarry out of which it is hewn. And as if to compensate
for much of the harm she has done, America has
wrought one great good in preserving many a pregnant Old-English
word, which we have been foolish enough to disown.<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a>
Provincialisms should be far more studied than they are; for
they will help us to settle many a difficult point,&mdash;where was
the boundary of the Anglian and the Frisian? how far on the
national character was the influence of the Dane felt? how
much, and in what way, did the Norman affect the daily business
of life?</p>
<p>Still more important is a country&rsquo;s folk-lore, as showing the
higher mental faculties of the race, in those legends and snatches
of song, and fragments of popular poetry, which speak the
popular feeling, and which not only contain its past history, but
foreshadow the future literature of a country; in those proverbs,
too, which tell the life and employment of a nation; and those
superstitions which give us such an insight into its moral
state.</p>
<p>Throughout the West of England still linger some few
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
stray waifs and legends of the past. In the New Forest Sir
Bevis of Southampton is no mythical personage, and the peasant
will tell how the Knight used to take his afternoon&rsquo;s walk,
across the Solent, from Leap to the Island.</p>
<p>Here in the Forest still dwell fairies. The mischievous
sprite, Laurence, still holds men by his spell and makes them
idle. If a peasant is lazy, it is proverbially said, &ldquo;Laurence has
got upon him,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;He has got a touch of Laurence.&rdquo; He
is still regarded with awe, and barrows are called after him.
Here, too, in the Forest still lives Shakspeare&rsquo;s Puck, a veritable
being, who causes the Forest colts to stray, carrying out word
for word Shakspeare&rsquo;s description,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am that merry wanderer of the night,</p>
<p class="t0">When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile</p>
<p class="t0">Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act ii., Sc. 1.)</p>
</div>
<p>This tricksy fairy, so the Forest peasant to this hour firmly
believes, inhabits the bogs, and draws people into them, making
merry, and laughing at their misfortunes, fulfilling his own
roundelay&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Up and down, up and down,</p>
<p class="t0">I will lead them up and down;</p>
<p class="t0">I am feared in field and town,</p>
<p class="t0">Goblin, lead them up and down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act iv., Sc. 2.)</p>
</div>
<p>Only those who are eldest born are exempt from his spell. The
proverb of &ldquo;as ragged as a colt Pixey&rdquo; is everywhere to be
heard, and at which Drayton seems to hint in his <i>Court of
Faerie</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This Puck seems but a dreaming dolt,</p>
<p class="t0">Still walking like a ragged colt.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He does not, however, in the Forest, so much skim the milk, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
play pranks with the chairs, but, as might be expected from the
nature of the country, misleads people on the moors, turning
himself into all sorts of shapes, as Shakspeare, Spenser, and
Jonson, have sung. There is scarcely a village or hamlet in
the Forest district which has not its &ldquo;Pixey Field,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pixey
Mead,&rdquo; or its &ldquo;Picksmoor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cold Pixey,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Puck
Piece.&rdquo; At Prior&rsquo;s Acre we find Puck&rsquo;s Hill, and not far from
it lies the great wood of Puckpits; whilst a large barrow on
Beaulieu Common is known as the Pixey&rsquo;s Cave.<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a></p>
<p>Then, too, on the south-west borders of the Forest remains
the legend, its inner meaning now perhaps forgotten, that the
Priory Church of Christchurch was originally to have been built
on the lonely St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill, instead of in the valley where
the people lived and needed religion. The stones, however,
which were taken up the hill in the day were brought down
in the night by unseen hands. The beams, too, which were
found too short on the heights, were more than long enough
in the town. The legend further runs, beautiful in its right
interpretation, that when the building was going on, there was
always one more workman&mdash;namely, Christ&mdash;than came on the
pay-night.</p>
<p>So, too, the poetry of the district has its own characteristics,
which it shares with that of the neighbouring western counties.
The homeliness of the songs in the West of England strangely
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
contrasts with the wild spirit of those of the North, founded
as the latter so often are on the border forays and raids of
former times. None which I have collected are direct enough
in their bearing on the New Forest to warrant quotation, and I
must content myself with this general expression.<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a></p>
<p>To pass on to other matters, let us notice some of the
superstitions of the New Forest. No one is now so superstitious,
because no one is so ignorant as the West-Saxon. One
of the commonest remedies for consumption in the Forest is
the &ldquo;lungs of oak,&rdquo; a lichen (<i>Sticta pulmonaria</i>) which grows
rather plentifully on the oak trees; and it is no unfrequent
occurrence for a poor person to ask at a chemist&rsquo;s shop for
a &ldquo;pennyworth of lungs of oak.&rdquo; So, too, for weak eyes,
&ldquo;brighten,&rdquo; another lichen, is recommended. I do not know,
however, that we must find so much fault in this matter, as
the lichens were not very long ago favourite prescriptions with
even medical men.</p>
<p>Again, another remedy for various diseases used to be the
scrapings from Sir John Chydioke&rsquo;s alabaster figure, in the
Priory Church of Christchurch, which has, in consequence, been
sadly injured. A specific, however, for consumption is still to
kill a jay and place it in the embers till calcined, when it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
then drunk at stated times in water. Hares&rsquo; brains are recommended
for infants prematurely born. Children suffering from
fits are, or rather were, passed through cloven ash-trees. Bread
baked on Good Friday will not only keep seven years, but
is a remedy for certain complaints. The seventh son of a
seventh son can perform cures. In fact, a pharmacop&oelig;ia of
such superstitions might be compiled.</p>
<p>The New Forest peasant puts absolute faith in all traditions,
believing as firmly in St. Swithin as his forefathers did when
the saint was Bishop of Winchester; turns his money, if he
has any, when he sees the new moon; fancies that a burn is
a charm against leaving the house; that witches cannot cross
over a brook; that the death&rsquo;s-head moth was only first seen
after the execution of Charles I.; that the man in the moon
was sent there for stealing wood from the Forest&mdash;a superstition,
by the way, mentioned in a slightly different form by Reginald
Pecock, Bishop of Chichester, in the fifteenth century.<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> And
the &ldquo;stolen bush,&rdquo; referred to by Caliban in the <i>Tempest</i> (Act ii.
sc. 2), and Bottom in the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i> (Act vi.
sc. 1), is still here called the &ldquo;nitch,&rdquo; or bundle of faggots.<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a></p>
<p>Not only this, but the barrows on the plains are named after
the fairies, and the peasant imagines, like the treasure-seekers of
the Middle-Ages, that they contain untold wealth, and that the
Forest wells are full of gold.<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a></p>
<p>I do not mean, however, to say that these beliefs are openly
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
avowed, or will even be acknowledged by the first labourer who
may be seen. The English peasant is at all times excessively
chary&mdash;no one perhaps more so&mdash;of expressing his full mind;
and a long time is required before a stranger can, if ever, gain
his confidence. But I do say that these superstitions are all,
with more or less credit, held in different parts of the Forest,
although even many who believe them the firmest would shrink,
from fear of ridicule, to confess the fact. Education has done
something to remove them; but they have too firm a hold to be
easily uprooted. They may not be openly expressed, but they
are, for all that, to my certain knowledge, still latent.</p>
<p>Old customs and ceremonies still linger. Mummers still
perform at Christmas. Old women &ldquo;go gooding,&rdquo; as in other
parts of England, on St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day. Boys and girls &ldquo;go
shroving&rdquo; on Ash Wednesday; that is, begging for meat and
drink at the farm-houses, singing this rude snatch:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I come a shroving, a shroving,</p>
<p class="t0">For a piece of pancake,</p>
<p class="t0">For a piece of truffle-cheese<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a></p>
<p class="t0">Of your own making.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When, if nothing is given, they throw stones and shards at
the door.<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Plenty, too, of old love superstitions remain&mdash;about ash
boughs with an even number of leaves, and &ldquo;four-leaved&rdquo; clover,
concerning which runs a Forest rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Even ash and four-leaved clover,</p>
<p class="t0">You are sure your love to see</p>
<p class="t0">Before the day is over.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, too, we must not forget the Forest proverbs. &ldquo;Wood
Fidley rain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hampshire and Wiltshire moon-rakers,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Keystone under the hearth,&rdquo; have already been noticed. But
there are others such as &ldquo;As yellow as a kite&rsquo;s claw,&rdquo; &ldquo;An iron
windfall,&rdquo; for anything unfairly taken, &ldquo;All in a copse,&rdquo; that is,
indistinct, &ldquo;A good bark-year makes a good wheat-year,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Like a swarm of bees all in a charm,&rdquo; explained further on,
which show the nature of the country. Again, &ldquo;A poor dry
thing, let it go,&rdquo; a sort of poacher&rsquo;s euphemism, like, &ldquo;The
grapes are sour,&rdquo; is said of the Forest hares when the dogs
cannot catch them, and so applied to things which are coveted
but out of reach. &ldquo;As bad as Jeffreys&rdquo; preserves, as throughout
the West of England, the memory of one who, instead of
being the judge, should have been the hangman. Again, too,
&ldquo;Eat your own side, speckle-back,&rdquo; is a common Forest expression,
and is used in reference to greedy people. It is said
to have taken its origin from a girl who shared her breakfast with
a snake, and thus reproved her favourite when he took too much.
Again, &ldquo;To rattle like a boar in a holme bush,&rdquo; is a thorough
proverb of the Forest district, where a &ldquo;holme&rdquo; bush means an
old holly. Passing, however, from particulars to generals, let
me add for the last, &ldquo;There is but one good mother-in-law, and
she is dead.&rdquo; I have never heard it elsewhere in England, but
doubtless it is common enough. It exactly corresponds with the
German saying, &ldquo;There is no good mother-in-law but she that
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
wears a green gown,&rdquo; that is, who lies in the churchyard. The
shrewdness and humour of a people are never better seen than
in their proverbs.</p>
<p>Further, there are plenty of local sayings, such as &ldquo;The
cuckoo goes to Beaulieu Fair to buy him a greatcoat,&rdquo; referring
to the arrival of the cuckoo about the 15th of April, whilst the
day on which the fair is held is known as the &ldquo;cuckoo day.&rdquo;
A similar proverb is to be found in nearly every county.
So, also, the saying with regard to Burley and its crop of mast
and acorns may be met in the Midland districts concerning
Pershore and its cherries. Like all other parts of England, the
Forest is full, too, of those sayings and adages, which are constantly
in the mouths of the lower classes, so remarkable for
their combination of both terseness and metaphor. To give an
instance, &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t climb up May Hill,&rdquo; that is, he will not
live through the cold spring. Again, &ldquo;A dog is made fat in two
meals,&rdquo; is applied to upstart or purse-proud people. But it is
dangerous to assign them to any particular district, as by their
applicability they have spread far and wide.</p>
<p>One or two historical traditions, too, still linger in the
Forest, but their value we have seen with regard to the death of
the Red King. Thus, the peasant will tell of the French fleet,
which, in June, 1690, lay off the Needles, and of the Battle
of Beachy Head&mdash;its cannonading heard even in the Forest&mdash;but
who fought, or why, he is equally ignorant. One tradition,
however, ought to be told concerning the terrible winter of 1787,
still known in the Forest as &ldquo;the hard year.&rdquo; My informant,
an old man, derived his knowledge from his father, who lived in
the Forest in a small lonely farm-house. The storm began in
the night; and when his father rose in the morning he could
not, on account of the snow-drift, open the door. Luckily, a back
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
room had been converted into a fuel-house, and his wife had
laid in a stock of provisions. The storm still increased. The
straggling hedges were soon covered; and by-and-by the woods
themselves disappeared. After a week&rsquo;s snow, a heavy frost
followed. The snow hardened. People went out shooting, and
wherever a breathing-hole in the snow appeared, fired, and nearly
always killed a hare.<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> The snow continued on the ground for
seven weeks; and when it melted, the stiffened bodies of horses
and deer covered the plains.<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a></p>
<p>And now for a few of the Forest words and expressions, many
of which are very peculiar. Take, for instance, the term
&ldquo;shade,&rdquo; which here has nothing in common with the shadows
of the woods, but means either a pool or an open piece of ground,
generally on a hill top, where the cattle in the warm weather
collect, or, as the phrase is, &ldquo;come to shade,&rdquo; for the sake of
the water in the one and the breeze in the other. Thus &ldquo;Ober
Shade&rdquo; means nothing more than Ober pond; whilst &ldquo;Stony
Cross Shade&rdquo; is a mere turfy plot. At times as many as a
hundred cows or horses are collected together in one of these
places, where the owners, or &ldquo;Forest marksmen,&rdquo; always first
go to look after a strayed animal. Nearly every &ldquo;Walk&rdquo; in
the Forest has its own &ldquo;Shade,&rdquo; called after its own name, and
we find the term used as far back as a perambulation of the
Forest in the twenty-second year of Charles II., where is mentioned
&ldquo;the Green Shade of Biericombe or Bircombe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It affords a good illustration of how words grow in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
meaning, and imperceptibly pass from one stage to another. It
originally signified nothing but a shadow, and then the place
where the shadow rests. In this second meaning it more
particularly became associated with the idea of coolness, but
gradually, whilst acquiring that idea, quite contrary to Milton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;unpierced shade&rdquo; (<i>Paradise Lost</i>, B. iv. 245), lost the notion
of that coolness being caused by the interception of light and
heat. In this sense it was transferred to any place which was
cool, and so at last applied, as in the New Forest, to bare spots
without a tree, deriving their coolness either from the breeze
or the water.</p>
<p>Another instance of the gradual change in the meaning of
words amongst provincialisms may be found in &ldquo;scale,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;squoyle.&rdquo; In the New Forest it properly signifies a short
stick loaded at one end with lead, answering to the &ldquo;libbet&rdquo; of
Sussex, and is distinguished from a &ldquo;snog,&rdquo; which is only
weighted with wood. With it also is employed the verb
&ldquo;to squoyle,&rdquo; better known in reference to the old sport of
&ldquo;cock-squoyling.&rdquo; From throwing at the squirrel the word was
used in reference to persons, so that &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t squoyle at me&rdquo; at
length meant, &ldquo;Do not slander me.&rdquo; Lastly, the phrase, now
still common, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw squoyles at me,&rdquo; comes by that forced
interpretation of obtaining a sense, which nearly always reverses
the original meaning, to signify, &ldquo;Do not throw glances at me.&rdquo;
And so in the New Forest at this day &ldquo;squoyles&rdquo; not unfrequently
mean glances.</p>
<p>There is, too, the word &ldquo;hat,&rdquo; which in the Forest takes
the place of &ldquo;clump,&rdquo; and is nearly equivalent to the Sussex
expression, &ldquo;a toll of trees.&rdquo; I have no doubt whatever that the
word had its origin in the high-crowned hats of the Puritans,
the &ldquo;long crown&rdquo; of the proverb; and in the first place referred
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
only to tall isolated clumps of trees. Now, however, it does not
merely mean a clump or ring, as the &ldquo;seven firs&rdquo; between Burley
and Ringwood, and Birchen, and Dark Hats, near Lyndhurst,
but any small irregular mass of trees, as the Withy Bed Hat in
the valley near Boldrewood.</p>
<p>Then of course, in connection with the Forest trees, many
peculiar words occur. The flower of the oak is called &ldquo;the
trail,&rdquo; and the oak-apple the &ldquo;sheets axe,&rdquo;&mdash;children carrying it
on the twenty-ninth of May, and calling out the word in derision
to those who are not so provided. The mast and acorns are
collectively known as &ldquo;the turn out,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ovest;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a> whilst the
badly-grown or stunted trees are called &ldquo;bustle-headed,&rdquo; equivalent
to the &ldquo;oak-barrens&rdquo; of America.</p>
<p>Other words there are, too, all proclaiming the woody nature
of the country. The tops of the oaks are termed, when lopped,
the &ldquo;flitterings,&rdquo; corresponding to the &ldquo;batlins&rdquo; of Suffolk.
The brush-wood is still occasionally Chaucer&rsquo;s &ldquo;rise,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rice,&rdquo;
connected with the German <i>reis</i>; and the beam tree, on account
of its silvery leaves, the &ldquo;white rice.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a> Frith, too, still means
copse-wood. The stem of the ivy is the &ldquo;ivy-drum.&rdquo; Stumps
of trees are known as &ldquo;stools,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;stooled stick&rdquo; is used
in opposition to &ldquo;maiden timber,&rdquo; which has never been touched
with the axe; whilst the roots are called &ldquo;mocks,&rdquo; &ldquo;mootes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;motes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mores.&rdquo; But about these last, which are all
used with nice shades of difference, we shall have, further on,
something to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Nor must we forget the bees which are largely kept throughout
the Forest, feeding on the heather, leading Fuller to remark
that Hampshire produced the best and worst honey in England.
The bee-season, as it is called, generally lasts, on account of the
heath, a month longer than on the Wiltshire downs. A great
quantity of the Old-English mead&mdash;<i>medu</i>&mdash;is still made, and it
is sold at much the same value as with the Old-English, being
three or four times the price of common beer, with which it is
often drunk. The bees, in fact, still maintain an important
place in the popular local bye-laws. Even in <i>Domesday</i> the
woods round Eling are mentioned as yearly yielding twelve
pounds&rsquo; weight of honey. As may therefore be expected, when
we remember that the whole of England was once called the
Honey Island, here, as elsewhere, plenty of provincialisms occur
concerning the bees.<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a></p>
<p>The drones are here named &ldquo;the big bees,&rdquo; the former word
being in some parts seldom used. The young are never said
to swarm, but &ldquo;to play,&rdquo; the word taking its origin from their
peculiar flight at the time: as Patmore writes,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Under the chestnuts new bees are swarming,</p>
<p class="t0">Falling and rising like magical smoke.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The caps of straw which are placed over the &ldquo;bee-pots,&rdquo; to
protect them from wet, are known as the &ldquo;bee-hackles,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bee-hakes.&rdquo; This is one of those expressive words which
is now only found in this form, and that, in the Midland
Counties, of &ldquo;wheat hackling,&rdquo; that is, covering the sheaves with
others in a peculiar way, to shelter them from the rain. About
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
the honeycombs, or, as they are more commonly called, &ldquo;workings,&rdquo;
the following rhyme exists:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sieve upon herder,<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a></p>
<p class="t0">One upon the other;</p>
<p class="t0">Holes upon both sides,</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the way, though,</p>
<p class="t0">What may it be? See if you know.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The entrance for the bees into the hive is here, as in Cambridgeshire
and some other counties, named the &ldquo;tee-hole,&rdquo;
evidently an onomatopoieia, from the buzzing or &ldquo;teeing&rdquo; noise,
as it is locally called, which the bees make. The piece of wood
placed under the &ldquo;bee-pots,&rdquo; to give the bees more room, is
known as &ldquo;the rear,&rdquo; still also, I believe, in use in America.
The old superstition, I may notice, is here more or less believed,
that the bees must be told if any death happens in a family,
or they will desert their hives. It is held, too, rather, perhaps,
as a tradition than a law, that if a swarm of bees flies away
the owner cannot claim them, unless, at the time, he has made
a noise with a kettle or tongs to give his neighbours notice. It
is on such occasions that the phrase &ldquo;Low brown&rdquo; may be
heard, meaning that the bees, or the &ldquo;brownies,&rdquo; as they are
called, are to settle low.</p>
<p>So also of the cattle, which are turned out in the Forest, we
find some curious expressions. A &ldquo;shadow cow&rdquo; is here what
would in other places be called &ldquo;sheeted,&rdquo; or &ldquo;saddle-backed,&rdquo;
that is, a cow whose body is a different colour to its hind and fore
parts.<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a>
A &ldquo;huff&rdquo; of cattle means a drove or herd, whilst the
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
cattle, which are entered in the marksman&rsquo;s books, are said to be
&ldquo;wood-roughed.&rdquo; A cow without horns is still called a &ldquo;not
cow&rdquo; (<i>hnot</i>), exactly corresponding to the American &ldquo;humble&rdquo;
or &ldquo;bumble cow,&rdquo; that is, shorn, illustrating, as Mr. Akerman
notices,<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a> Chaucer&rsquo;s line,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A not hed had he, with a brown visage.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the Forest, too, as in all other districts, a noticeable point
is the number of words formed by the process of onomatopoieia.
Thus, to take a few examples, we have the expressive verb to
&ldquo;scroop,&rdquo; meaning to creak, or grate, as a door does on rusty
hinges; and again the word &ldquo;hooi,&rdquo; applied to the wind
whistling round a corner, or through the key-hole, making the
sound correspond to the sense. It exactly represents the harsh
creaking, as the Latin <i>susurrus</i> and the
&psi;&iota;&theta;&#8059;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha; of Theocritus
reflect the whisperings of the wind in the pines and
poplars, resembling, as Tennyson says, &ldquo;a noise of falling
showers.&rdquo; Again, such words as &ldquo;clocking,&rdquo; &ldquo;gloxing,&rdquo;
applied to falling, gurgling water; &ldquo;grizing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;snaggling,&rdquo;
said of a dog snarling; &ldquo;whittering,&rdquo; or &ldquo;whickering&rdquo;&mdash;exactly
equivalent to the German <i>wiehern</i>&mdash;of a young colt&rsquo;s
neighing; &ldquo;belloking,&rdquo; of a cow&rsquo;s lowing&mdash;are all here commonly
used, and are similarly formed. Names of animals take
their origin in the same way. The wry-neck, called the
&ldquo;barley-bird&rdquo; in Wiltshire, and the &ldquo;cuckoo&rsquo;s mate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;messenger&rdquo; elsewhere, is in the Forest known as the
&ldquo;weet-bird,&rdquo; from its peculiar cry of &ldquo;weet;&rdquo; which it will
repeat at short intervals for an hour together. So, too, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
common green woodpecker is here, as is in some other parts of
England, called, from its loud shrill laugh, the &ldquo;yaffingale.&rdquo;
The goat-sucker, too, is the &ldquo;jar-bird,&rdquo; so known from its
jarring noise, which has made the Welsh peasant name it the
&ldquo;wheel-bird&rdquo; (<i>aderyn y droell</i>), and the Warwickshire the
&ldquo;spinning-jenny.&rdquo; In fact, a large number of birds in every
language are thus called, and to this day in the cry of the
peacock we may plainly hear its Greek name, &tau;&alpha;&#8182;&sigmaf;.</p>
<p>Of course, we must be on our guard against adopting the
onomatopo&euml;tic theory as altogether explaining the origin of
language. Within, however, certain limits, especially with a
peculiar class of provincialisms, it gives us, as here, true aid.<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a></p>
<p>Again, as an example of phrases used by our Elizabethan
poets, preserved only by our peasantry, though in good use in
America, take the word &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo; so common throughout the
Forest, meaning a valley, glen, or glade. Beaumont and Fletcher
and Shakspeare frequently employ it. Even Milton, in <i>Paradise
Regained</i>, says&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But cottage, herd, or sheepcote, none he saw,</p>
<p class="t0">Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(Book ii. 289.)</p>
</div>
<p>In his <i>Comus</i>, too, we find him using the compound &ldquo;bottom-glade,&rdquo;
just as the Americans speak to this day of the &ldquo;bottom-lands&rdquo;
of the Ohio, and our own peasants of Slufter Bottom,
and Longslade Bottom, in the New Forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heft,&rdquo; too, is another similar instance of an Old-English
word in good use in America and to be found in the best
American authors, but here in England only employed by our
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
rustics. To &ldquo;heft&rdquo; (from <i>hebban</i>, with the inflexions, <i>hefest</i>,
&ldquo;hef&eth;,&rdquo; still used), signifies to lift, with the implied meaning of
weighing. So, &ldquo;to heft the bee-pots,&rdquo; is to lift them in order
to feel how much honey they contain. The substantive &ldquo;heft&rdquo;
is used for weight, as, &ldquo;the heft of the branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, also, the good Old-English word &ldquo;loute&rdquo; (<i>lutan</i>), to
bend, bow, and so to touch the hat, to be heard every day in the
Forest, though nearly forgotten elsewhere in England, may be
found in Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Children of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t9">&ldquo;as oft as they named the Redeemer,</p>
<p class="t0">Lowly louted the boys, and lowly the maidens all courtesied.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In fact, one-half of the words which are considered Americanisms
are good Old-English words, which we have been foolish
enough to discard.</p>
<p>Let us now take another class of words, which will help to
explain difficult or corrupt passages in our poets. There is, for
instance, the word &ldquo;bugle&rdquo; (<i>buculus</i>), meaning an ox (used,
as Mr. Wedgwood<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a> notices, in Deut. xiv. in the Bible, 1551),
which is forgotten even by the peasantry, and only to be seen,
as at Lymington and elsewhere, on a few inn-signs, with a
picture sometimes of a cow, by way of explanation. I have
more than once thought, that when Rosalind, in <i>As You Like It</i>
(Act iii., sc. 5), speaks of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s &ldquo;bugle eyeballs,&rdquo; she means
not merely her sparkling eyes, as the notes say, but rather her
large, expressive eyes, in the sense in which Homer calls Her&ecirc;
&beta;&omicron;&#8182;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;.</p>
<p>To give another illustration of the value of provincialisms
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
in such cases, let us take the word &ldquo;bumble,&rdquo; which not only
in the New Forest means, in its onomatopo&euml;tic sense, to buzz,
hum, or boom, as in the common proverb, &ldquo;to bumble like a
bee in a tar-tub,&rdquo; and as Chaucer says, in <i>The Wife of Bath&rsquo;s
Tale</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A bytoure bumbleth in the myre,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but is also used of people stumbling or halting. Probably, in
<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (Act iii., sc. 3), in the passage
which has been of such difficulty to the commentators, where
Mrs. Ford says to the servants, who are carrying Falstaffe in
the buck-basket&mdash;&ldquo;Look, how you drumble,&rdquo; which has no
meaning at all, we should, instead, read this word. It, at all
events, not only conveys good sense, but is the exact kind of
word which the passage seems to expect.</p>
<p>Again, the compound &ldquo;thiller-horse,&rdquo; from the Old-English
&ldquo;&thorn;ill,&rdquo; a beam or shaft, and so, literally, the shaft-horse,
which we find in Shakspeare under the form of &ldquo;thill-horse&rdquo;
(<i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act ii., sc. 2), is here commonly used.</p>
<p>Then there are other forms among provincialisms which give
such an insight into the formation of language, and show the
common mind of the human race. Thus, take the word &ldquo;three-cunning,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a>
to be heard every day in the Forest, where three has
the signification of intensity, just as the Greek
&tau;&rho;&#8055;&sigmaf; in composition in the compounds
&tau;&rho;&#8055;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;,
&tau;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&#8049;&theta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
and other forms.
So, too, the missel-thrush is called the &ldquo;bull-thrush,&rdquo; with the
meaning of size attached to the word, as it is more commonly
to our own &ldquo;horse,&rdquo; and the Greek &#7989;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
and the Old-English <i>hrefen</i>, raven, in composition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>As might be expected, from what we have seen of the population
of the Forest, the Romance element in its provincialisms
is very small. Some few words, such as &ldquo;merry,&rdquo; for a cherry;
&ldquo;fogey,&rdquo; for passionate; &ldquo;futy,&rdquo; for foolish; &ldquo;rue,&rdquo; for a
hedge; &ldquo;glutch,&rdquo; to stifle a sob&mdash;have crept in, besides such
Forest terms as verderer, regarder, agister, agistment, &amp;c., but
the majority are Teutonic. Old-English inflexions, too, still
remain. Such plurals as placen, housen, peasen, gripen, fuzzen,
ashen, and hosen, as we find in Daniel, ch. iii. v. 21; such
perfects as crope, from creep; lod, from lead; fotch, from fetch;
and such phrases as &ldquo;thissum&rdquo; (&ldquo;&thorn;issum&rdquo;), and &ldquo;thic&rdquo; for
that, are daily to be heard.</p>
<p>Let us, for instance, take the adjective vinney, evidently
from the Old-English <i>finie</i>, signifying, in the first place,
mouldy; and, since mould is generally blue or purplish, having
gradually attached to it the signification of colour. Thus we
find the mouldy cheese not only named &ldquo;vinney,&rdquo; but a roan
heifer called a &ldquo;vinney heifer.&rdquo; The most singular part, however,
as exemplifying the changes of words, remains to be told.
Since cheese, from its colour, was called &ldquo;vinney,&rdquo; the word
was applied to some particular cheese, which was mouldier
and bluer than others, and the adjective was thus changed into
a substantive. And we now have &ldquo;vinney,&rdquo; and the tautology,
&ldquo;blue vinney,&rdquo; as the names of a particular kind of cheese as
distinguished from the other local cheeses, known as &ldquo;ommary&rdquo;
and &ldquo;rammel.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a></p>
<p>So also with the word &ldquo;charm,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;churm,&rdquo; signifying,
in the first place, noise or disturbance, from the Old-English
<i>cyrm</i>. We meet it every day in the common Forest
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
proverb, &ldquo;Like a swarm of bees all in a churm,&rdquo; whilst the
fowlers on the coast talk also of the wild ducks &ldquo;being in
a churm,&rdquo; when they are in confusion, flapping their wings
before they settle or rise. We find it, too, in the old Wiltshire
song of the &ldquo;Owl&rsquo;s Mishap,&rdquo; to be sometimes heard on
the northern borders of the Forest:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At last a hunted zo ver away,</p>
<p class="t">That the zun kum peping auver the hills,</p>
<p class="t0">And the burds wakin up they did un espy,</p>
<p class="t">And wur arl in a churm az un whetted their bills.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The word was doubtless in the first place an onomatopoieia,
denoting the humming, buzzing sound of wings. Since, however,
it was particularly connected with birds, it seems to have
been used in the sense of music and song by our Elizabethan
poets, and by Milton. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet</p>
<p class="t">With charm of earliest birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book iv. 642.)</p>
</div>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Morn when she ascends</p>
<p class="t0">With charm of earliest birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book iv. 651.)</p>
</div>
<p>Here, however, in the New Forest, we find the original signification
of the word preserved.</p>
<p>Let us further notice one or two more words, which are
used by Milton and his contemporaries, and even much later,
but which are now found in the Forest, and doubtless elsewhere,
as mere provincialisms. Thus, though we do not meet his
&ldquo;tale,&rdquo; in the sense of number, as in <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And every shepherd tells his tale,</p>
<p class="t0">Under the hawthorn in the dale;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&mdash;that is, number of sheep: we find its allied word &ldquo;toll,&rdquo; to
count. &ldquo;I toll ten cows,&rdquo; is no very uncommon expression.
Then, too, we have the word &ldquo;tole,&rdquo; used, as I believe it
still is in America, of enticing animals, and thus metaphorically
applied to other matters. So, in this last sense, Milton speaks
of the title of a book, &ldquo;Hung out like a toling sign-post to
call passengers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a></p>
<p>Again, too, the bat is here called &ldquo;rere-mouse&rdquo;
(from the Old-English <i>hrere-mus</i>,
from <i>hreran</i> to flutter, literally the fluttering mouse,
the exact equivalent of the German Flitter-maus<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a>),
with its varieties rennie-mouse and reiny-mouse,<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> whilst the adjective
&ldquo;rere&rdquo; is sometimes used, as in Wiltshire, for raw. On
the other hand, the word fliddermouse, or, as in the eastern
division of Sussex, flindermouse (from the High-German <i>fledermaus</i>),
does not, to my knowledge, occur. In the Midland
counties it is often known as &ldquo;leathern wings&rdquo; (compare
<i>ledermus</i>); and thus, Shakspeare, with his large vocabulary,
using up every phrase and metaphor which he ever met, makes
Titania say of her fairies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Some war with rear-mice for their leathern wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">(<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Act ii., sc. 3.)</p>
</div>
<p>To take a few words common, not only to the New Forest,
but to various parts of the West of England, we shall see how
strong is the Old-English element here in the common speech.
The housewife still baits (<i>betan</i>, literally to repair, and so, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
joined with <i>fyr</i>, to light) the fire, and on cold days makes it
blissy (connected with <i>blysa</i>, a torch). The crow-boy in the
spring sets up a gally-bagger (<i>g&aelig;lan</i>, in its last meaning to
terrify), instead of the &ldquo;maukin&rdquo; of the north, to frighten
away the birds from the seed; and the shepherd still tends his
chilver-lamb (<i>cilferlamb</i>) in the barton (<i>bere tun</i>, literally the
barley enclosure). The labourer still sits under the lew (<i>hleow</i>,
or &ldquo;hleow&eth;,&rdquo; shelter, warmth) of the hedge, which he has been
ethering (&ldquo;e&eth;er,&rdquo; a hedge); and drives the stout (<i>stut</i>, a gadfly)
away from his horses; and feels himself lear (<i>l&aelig;rnes</i>, emptiness),
before he eats his nammit (<i>n&oacute;n-mete</i>), or his dew-bit (<i>deaw-bite</i>).</p>
<p>If we will only open our Bible we shall there find many
an old word which could be better explained by the Forest
peasants than any one else. Here the ploughman still talks of
his &ldquo;dredge,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;drudge,&rdquo; that is, oats mixed with
barley, just as we find the word used in the marginal reading of
Job xxiv. v. 6. Here, too, as in Amos (chap. iv., v. 9), and other
places, the caterpillar is called the &ldquo;palmer-worm.&rdquo; Here, also,
as in other parts of England, the word &ldquo;lease,&rdquo; from the Old-English
<i>lesan</i>, is far commoner than glean, and is used just as
we find it in Wycliffe&rsquo;s Bible, Lev. xix., 10:&mdash;&ldquo;In thi vyneyeerd
the reysonus and cornes fallynge down thou shalt not gedere,
but to pore men and pilgrimes to ben lesid thou shalt leeve.&rdquo;
The goatsucker is known, as we have seen, not only as the
&ldquo;jar-bird,&rdquo; but as the &ldquo;night-hawk,&rdquo; as in Leviticus
(chap. xi., v. 16) and Deuteronomy (chap. xiv., v. 15); and
also the &ldquo;night-crow,&rdquo; as we find it called in Barker&rsquo;s Bible
(1616) in the same passages. So also the word &ldquo;mote,&rdquo; in the
well-known passage in St. Matthew (chap. viii., v. 3), is not here
obsolete. The peasant in the Forest speaks of the &ldquo;motes,&rdquo;
that is, the stumps and roots of trees, in opposition to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
smaller &ldquo;mores,&rdquo; applied also to the fibres of ferns and furze,
whilst the sailor on the coast calls the former &ldquo;mootes,&rdquo; when
he dredges them up in the Channel.<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a></p>
<p>With this I must stop. I will only add that the study of the
West Saxon dialect in the counties of Hants, Wilts, and Dorset,
is all-important. As we go westward we shall find it less pure,
and more mixed with Keltic. As is well known, the Britons
lived with the Old-English in perfect harmony in Exeter. Their
traces remain there to this day. In these three counties, therefore,
are the most perfect specimens of the West-Saxon dialect
to be found. Mr. Thorpe has noticed in the Old-English text
of <i>Orosius</i>, which is now generally ascribed to Alfred, the
change of <i>a</i> into <i>o</i> and <i>o</i> into <i>a</i>, and also the same peculiarity in
Alfred&rsquo;s <i>Boethius</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a> This we have already, in the last chapter,
seen to be purely West-Saxon. I have no doubt whatever that
at even the present day it is not too late to find other points of
similarity, and make still clearer the West-Saxon origin of the
Corpus Christi manuscript of the <i>Chronicle</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a> and how far even
Alfred and St. Swithin contributed to its pages. These are
difficult questions; but I feel sure that much additional light
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
can even yet be obtained. Sound criticism would show as much
difference between our local dialects, whether even Anglian,
or South, or West-Saxon, as between the Doric and Attic
of Greece. I have dealt only with the broader features of
the Old-English tongue, as it is still spoken in the Forest.
Enough, however, I trust, has been shown of the value of provincialisms,
even when collected over so limited a space. Everywhere
in England we shall find Teutonic words, which are not
so much the mould into which all other forms have been cast, as
the living germ of our language. Mixed and imbedded with
these, as we have also seen, we shall meet Keltic and Romance,
by both of which our language has been so influenced and
modified. Let us not be ashamed to collect them; for by
them we may explain not only obscure passages in our old
authors, but doubtful points in our very history.</p>

</div>
<p>It is much to be regretted that Sir Walter Scott has left no
account of his excavations of various barrows in the Forest.
However little we may be able to determine by the evidence,
or however conjectural the inferences which we may draw, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
will, at least, be this value to this chapter, that it will put
on record facts which otherwise could not be known.</p>
<p>The barrows lie scattered all over the Forest, and are known
to the Foresters by the name of &ldquo;butts,&rdquo; some of the largest
being distinguished by local appellations. As in other parts
of England, and as in France, superstition connects them with
the fairies; and so we find on Beaulieu Plain two mounds
known as the Pixey&rsquo;s Cave and Laurence&rsquo;s Barrow.</p>
<p>My own excavations have been entirely confined to the Keltic
barrows in the northern part of the Forest.<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> But we will
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
first of all take those on Sway and Shirley Commons, opened
by Warner.<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a> The largest stands a little to the east of Shirley
Holms, close to Fetmoor Pond, measuring about a hundred
yards in circumference, and surrounded by three smaller mounds
varying from thirty to fifty yards, and two more nearly indistinct.
These two last are, I suspect, those opened by
Warner, where, after piercing the mound, he found on the
natural soil a layer of burnt earth mixed with charcoal, and
below this, at the depth of two feet, a small coarse urn with
&ldquo;an inverted brim,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a> containing ashes and calcined bones.</p>
<p>Some more lie to the northward, and are distinguished by
being trenched. Two of these also were opened by Warner,
but he failed to discover anything beyond charcoal and burnt
earth.</p>
<p>His opinion was that these last belonged to the West-Saxons
and the former to the Kelts, who were slain defending their
country against Cerdic. So large a generalization, however,
requires far stronger evidence than can at present be produced.</p>
<p>Warner, too, is besides wrong in much of his criticism, such
as that the Teutonic nations never practised urn-burial; whilst
the banks in which he sees fortifications may be only the
embankments within which dwelt a British population.</p>
<p>Still there is some probability about the conjecture. A
little farther down the Brockenhurst stream are Ambrose Hole
and Ampress Farm, both names unmistakeably referring to
Ambrosius Aurelianus, or Natan-Leod, who led the Britons
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
against their invaders. Nearer Lymington, too, stands Buckland
Rings,<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a>
a Roman camp, with its south and north sides
still nearly perfect, to which, perhaps, Natan-Leod fell back
from Calshot.</p>
<p>All this, however, must be accepted as mere conjecture.
A more critical examination of these barrows is still wanting.</p>
<p>Close to them, however, lies Latchmoor or Lichmoor Pond,
the moor of corpses, a name which we meet again a little to the
westward in Latchmoor Water, which flows by Ashley Common.
The words are noticeable, and in connection with Darrat&rsquo;s
(Dane-rout) stream, which is also not far distant may point
to a very different invasion.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a></p>
<p>And now we will pass to the barrows which I have opened.
The first are situated on Bratley Plain, as the name shows, a
wide heath, marked only by a few hollies and the undulations of
the scattered mounds. The largest barrow lies close to the sixth
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
milestone on the Ringwood Road. In a straight line to the
north, at the distance of a quarter of a mile apart, rise three
others, whilst round it on the east side lie a quantity of small
circles, so low as hardly to be discernible when the heather
is in bloom. An irregularly shaped oval, it rose in the centre
to a height of nearly six feet above the ground, measuring
sixteen yards in breadth, and twenty-two in length, with a circumference
of from sixty to sixty-five. On the south side was a
depression from whence the gravel had been obtained. We first
cut a trench two yards broad, so as to take the centre, and at
about two feet and a half from the surface came upon traces
of charcoal, which increased till we reached the floor. A few
round stones, probably, as they bore some slight artificial marks,
used for slinging, and the flake of, perhaps, a flint knife, were
the only things found, and were all placed on the south side.
We now cut the mound from east to west, and on the east
side, resting on the floor, we discovered the remains of a Keltic
urn. The parts were, however, in a most fragile state, and
in some instances had resolved themselves into mere clay,
and we could only obtain two small fragments, sufficient to show
the coarseness and extreme early age of the ware. No charcoal
nor osseous matter could be detected adhering to the sides,
which, as we shall see, is generally the case.</p>
<p>Round it, as was stated, lie a quantity of small grave-circles,
varying from twenty-five to ten yards in circumference, and
scarcely better defined than fairy-rings. Two of these I opened,
and they corresponded with the mounds on Sway Common
examined by Warner, in having a grave about three feet deep, in
which we found only charcoal. This was, however, the only
point of resemblance, as they had no mound, and contained no
urn. One fact is worth noticing, that they were dug in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
remarkably hard gravelly soil, so hard that the labourers
made very slow progress even with their pick-axes. I did not
excavate any more, as they were all evidently of the same
character. The choice of such a soil, especially with the instruments
they possessed, may, perhaps, show the importance which
the Britons attached to the rite of burial.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile, or rather less, from this great
graveyard lay a solitary mound, two feet and a half in height,
having a circumference of twenty-seven feet, a very common
measurement, but without any trench. Upon digging into it
on the east side we quickly came, about four inches from the
surface, upon a patch of charcoal and burnt earth. Proceeding
farther, we reached two well-defined layers of charcoal, the
uppermost two feet from the top of the barrow. A band of
red burnt earth, measuring five inches, separated these two beds,
in both of which in places appeared white spots and patches
of limy matter, the remains of calcined bones. In the centre,
as shown in the illustration, we found a Keltic urn. Imbedded
in a fine white burnt clay, which had hardened, placed with its
mouth uppermost, and ornamented with a rough cable-moulding,
and two small ears, it stood on the level of the natural soil,
rising to within sixteen inches of the top of the mound.</p>
<p>Digging on both sides, we discovered two more urns imbedded
in the same hard white sandy clay, so hard that it had
to be scraped away with knives. Like the first, they were made
by hand, and when exposed quite shone with a bright vermilion,
which quickly changed to a dull grey. The paste, however, was
a light yellow, mixed with coarse gritty sand. And the three
were placed, as shown by the compass, exactly due north-east
and south-west.</p>
<p>A plain moulding ran round the south-west urn, which was
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
considerably smaller and not so well baked as the other two, and
had very much fallen to pieces from natural decay. This was
placed eight inches lower than the central urn.</p>
<p>The northernmost was the same size as the central, though
differing from it in the contraction of the rim, and when discovered
was perfectly whole, but was unfortunately fractured by
being separated from a large furze root, which had completely
twined round the upper part. It, too, was placed on a lower
level, by four inches, than the central urn. The two extreme
urns were exactly five feet apart, and the interiors of them all
were blackened by the carbon from the charcoal, burnt earth,
and bones, which they contained.</p>
<p>Looking at their rude forms and large size, their straight
sides, their wide mouths, the thickness, and the rough gritty
texture of the paste,<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a> the absence of nearly all ornamentation,
and, with the exception, perhaps, of a slinging stone, of all
weapons, we shall not be wrong in dating them as long anterior
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
to the Roman invasion&mdash;how long a more minute criticism
and a greater accumulation of facts than is now possessed, can
alone determine.</p>
<p>There are, however, one or two points peculiarly noticeable
about this barrow&mdash;first, the enormous quantity of burnt earth,
suggesting that the funeral pyre was actually lit on the spot,
which certainly was not the case in most of the other barrows,
where the charcoal is only sprinkled here and there, or appears
in the form of a small circular patch on the floor. Secondly,
the two bands of charcoal, so full of osseous matter, would
certainly go far to prove, what has been surmised by Bateman
and others, that the slaves or prisoners were immolated at the
decease of their master or conqueror.</p>
<p>Again, too, the different sizes and positions of the urns
may, perhaps, indicate either degrees of relationship or rank of
the persons buried. And this theory is somewhat corroborated
by the contents. The central urn was examined on the spot,
and, like all the others, with the exception of a round stone
slightly indented, contained burnt earth, limy matter, and at
the bottom the larger bones, which were less calcined, but
which, owing to the want of proper means, we could not
preserve. The other two were opened at the British Museum.
At the bottom of the north-easternmost were also placed bones
in a similar condition, amongst which Professor Owen recognized
the <i>femur</i> and <i>radius</i> of an adult. The smallest urn also
showed bones placed in the same manner at the bottom, but in
this case smaller, and amongst them Professor Owen determined
<i>processus dentatus</i>, and the body of the third cervical
vertebra, and was of opinion that they were those of a person
of small stature, or, perhaps, of a female. This is what might
have been expected. And the fact of their being put in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
smallest vessel, which, as we have noticed, was placed below
the level of the others, certainly indicates a distinction made
in the mode of burial of persons of either different ages or
sexes.</p>
<p>The fact, too, that all the larger bones were placed by themselves
at the bottom is worth noticing, and shows that they
must have been carefully collected and separated from the burnt
earth and charcoal of the pyre.</p>
<p>About another quarter of a mile off rise two more barrows,
measuring exactly the same in circumference as the last, though
not nearly so high, being raised only sixteen inches above the
ground. Upon opening the southernmost, we soon came, on
the east side, upon traces of charcoal, which increased to a
bed of an inch and a half in thickness as we reached the
centre. Here we found an urn of coarse pottery exactly similar
in texture to those in the previous barrow. It was, however, in
such a bad state of preservation, and so soft, from the wetness
of the ground, that the furze-roots had grown through the sides,
and it crumbled to bits on being touched. Some few pieces,
though, near the bottom, we were able to preserve. Its shape,
however, was well shown by the form which its contents had
taken. It seems to have been, though much smaller, exactly
of the same rude, straight-sided, and wide-mouthed pattern
as the other urns, measuring seven inches in height, and in
circumference, near the top, two feet two inches, and at the
bottom, one foot four inches. The cast was composed entirely
of burnt stones, and black earth, and osseous matter, reduced to
lime, in which the furze-roots had imbedded themselves.</p>
<p>The fellow barrow, which was only about fifty yards distant,
and whose measurements were exactly the same, contained also
charcoal, though not in such large quantities, and fragments
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
of an urn placed not in the centre, but near the extreme western
edge. The remains here were in a still worse state of decomposition,
and we could obtain no measurements, but only one
or two pieces of ware, which, in their general coarseness and
grittiness of texture, corresponded with the others, and not only
showed their Keltic manufacture, but their extreme early date.<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a></p>
<p>This last mound, I may add, was composed of gravel,
whilst the other was made simply of mould: and two depressions
on the heath showed where the material had been
obtained.</p>
<p>About two miles to the north-east, close to Ocknell Pond,
lies a single barrow of much the same size as these two, though
a great deal higher, being raised in the centre to three feet
and a half. We began the excavation on the east side, proceeding
to the centre, but found nothing except some charcoal,
and peculiarly-shaped rolled flints, placed on the level of the
ground.</p>
<p>We then made another trench from the north side, and
close to some charcoal, about a foot and a half below the raised
surface, came upon the neck of a Roman wine vessel (<i>ampulla</i>).
Although we opened the whole of the east side, we could not
find the remaining portion. The barrow bore no traces of
having been previously explored, nor did the soil appear to have
been moved. The fracture was certainly not recent, and it is
very possible that some disappointed treasure-seekers in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
Middle Ages had forestalled us, and time had obliterated all
their marks in opening the mound.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill42">
<img id="fig42" src="images/image206.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Neck of Roman Wine Vessel, Keltic Urn, and Flint Knives.</p>
</div>
<p>From the position of the vessel at the top of the barrow,
there had evidently been a second interment. The remains,
however, are in accordance with what we might have expected.
The barrow is situated not far from the Romano-British
potteries of Sloden, and close to it run great banks, known as
the Row-ditch, marking, in all probability, the settlements of a
Romano-British population.<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>On Fritham Plain, not far from Gorely Bushes, lies another
vast graveyard. The grave-circles are very similar in size to
those round the large barrow on Bratley Plain, though a good
deal higher, with, here and there, some oval mounds ranged
side by side, as in a modern churchyard. In the autumn
of 1862, I opened five of these, with the same result of finding
charcoal in all, though placed in different parts, but in all
instances resting on the natural ground, and giving evidence
of only one interment. As in other cases, the grave-heaps were
often alternately composed of mould and gravel. No traces
of urns or celts were found, but in one or two a quantity
of small circular stones, with indistinct marks of borings,
which could hardly have accidentally collected.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile off, on the road to Whiteshoot,<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a>
lies, however, a square mound, measuring nine yards each
way, and averaging a foot and a half in height. On opening
it on the north side, we came upon the fragments of an
urn, but so much decayed that we could only tell that they
were, probably, Keltic. On the west side, another trench,
which had been made, showed the presence of charcoal, which
kept increasing till we reached the centre, where we found
what appeared to be the remains of three separate urns, placed
in a triangle at about a yard apart. These also were in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
same decayed state, and crumbled to pieces as we endeavoured
to separate them from the soil. With some difficulty we
managed to preserve a few fragments which were identical with
those which had been previously discovered in the other barrows
at Bratley. They contained, like most of the other vessels,
burnt stones and white osseous matter reduced to lime. There
seems, however, to have been some difference in their texture
with that of the fragments found on the north side, which were
less gritty and coarse, and which bore no traces of charcoal or
lime.<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a></p>
<p>We will now leave Fritham, and cross Sloden and Amberwood
Plantation. Not far from Amberwood Corner, and above
Pitt&rsquo;s Enclosure, stand two barrows. The largest was opened
thirty years ago by a labouring man, who, to use his own
language, &ldquo;constantly dreamt that he should there find a crock
of gold.&rdquo; His opening was rewarded by discovering only some
charcoal. In 1851, the Rev. J. Pemberton Bartlett also explored
it with still less success. It is, however, a remarkable barrow,
and differs in character from any of the preceding, being composed
in the interior of large sub-angular flints, and cased on
the outside with a rampart of earth. Beyond it lies another,
very different in style, being made only of earth. This was
also opened by Mr. Bartlett, who found some pieces of charcoal,
and small fragments of a very coarsely-made urn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>About a mile away on Butt&rsquo;s Plain rise five more barrows,
and beyond them again two more. Of the first five, two were
explored by Mr. Bartlett, who was unsuccessful, and two by
myself.</p>
<p>The two which I opened lie on the right of the track leading
from Amberwood to the Fordingbridge road. The northernmost
was considerably the largest, having a circumference of fifty
yards, and was composed simply of gravel and earth. In it
we found only a circle of charcoal placed nearly in the centre
on the level of the ground.</p>
<p>The other was more remarkable. It measured only thirty
yards in circumference, but was composed in the centre of raised
earth, above which were piled large rolled flints, making a
stratum of from two to three feet in depth on the sides, but
gradually becoming thinner as it reached the centre, which was
barely covered. It thus totally differed from that near Amberwood,
where the earth flanked the stones instead of being the
nucleus round which they were placed. In it we found a circle
of charcoal ingrained with limy matter, a few remains of much
calcined bones, and a fine stone hammer bored with two holes
slantwise, to give a greater purchase to the handle.</p>
<p>Besides these, I opened a solitary barrow situated between
Handycross Pond and Pinnock Wood, close to Akercombe
Bottom. It measured twenty-seven yards in circumference,
and three feet in height. After digging into it near the centre,
we found in the white sand, of which the mound was chiefly
composed, a good deal of charcoal on and below the level of
the ground, but failed to discover any traces of an urn, although
we went down to a considerable depth.</p>
<p>Further, a solitary oval mound stood on the south side
of South Bentley, half way between it and Anses Wood. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
measured two feet and a half in height, twelve yards in length,
and seven in breadth. This also I opened, but failed to find
even any remains of charcoal, and, from the easy-moving nature
of the soil, am inclined to suspect that it was modern, and
raised for some other purpose than that of burial. On the
east side was a depression filled with water, from whence the
soil was taken.</p>
<p>The most remarkable barrow, if it can be so called, in this
part of the Forest, is at Black Bar, at the extreme west end
of Linwood, measuring nearly four hundred yards in circumference,
and rising to the height of forty feet or more. It is
evidently in part factitious, for upon sinking a pit ten feet
deep we reached charcoal mixed with Roman pottery, but not
of a sepulchral character.</p>
<p>In its general appearance the mound is not unlike the
famous Barney Barn&rsquo;s Hill, in Dibden Bottom, and close to
it rises another, known as the Fir Pound, not much inferior
in size. I made other openings on the top and sides, but
discovered nothing further. To excavate it thoroughly would
require an enormous time, and would in all probability not
repay the labour. It looks, however, by the depressions on the
summit, as if it had once been the site of Keltic dwellings.
And this is in some measure corroborated by a small mound
close to it, where, as if apparently left or thrown away, we
found placed in a hole a small quantity of extremely coarse
pottery&mdash;the coarsest and thickest which I have ever seen.
Again, too, in a field close by, known as Blackheath Meadow,
we everywhere met traces of Romano-British ware, very similar
in shape and texture to that in Sloden, described in the next
chapter.</p>
<p>The whole district just round here is most interesting.
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
About a mile to the north is Latchmoor Stream and Latchmoor
Green, marking, doubtless, some burial-ground; and not far
off stands one of those elevated places, common in the Forest,
with the misleading title of Castle.</p>
<p>I must not, too, forget to mention some barrows on Langley
Heath, just outside the present eastern boundary of the Forest,
and especially interesting from being situated so near to Calshot,
where, as we have seen, Cerdic probably landed. Seven of them
were opened by the Rev. J. Pemberton Bartlett. The mounds,
averaging about twenty yards in circumference, were, in some
cases, slightly raised, as much as a foot and a half, though
in others nearly on a level with the natural surface of the soil.
In them all was found a single grave, though, in one instance,
two, running about three feet in depth, and containing only
burnt earth and charcoal. They thus exactly corresponded,
with the exception of the slight mound, with those on Bratley
Plain.</p>
<p>With this we must conclude.<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a> It would not be difficult to
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
frame some theory from these results. I, however, here prefer
to allow the simple facts to remain. As we have seen, the
barrows in this part of the Forest, like all others of the same
period, contained nothing, with the exception of the single stone-hammer,
and the slinging pebbles, and the flake of flint, but
nearly plain urns, full of only burnt earth, charcoal, and human
bones. No iron, bronze, nor bone-work of any sort, was found,
which would still further go to prove their extreme early age.
Curiously enough, too, no teeth, bones, nor horn-cores of
animals were discovered, as so often are in Keltic barrows.<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a>
Like all others, too, of an early date, there seem to have been
several burials in the same grave, though this, as on Fritham
Plain, is very far from being always the case. Some little
regularity evidently prevailed with the different septs. Some,
as at Bratley, placed the charred remains in a grave from two
to three feet in depth; others, as at Butt&rsquo;s Plain, on the mere
ground. On the other hand, a good deal of caprice seems to
have been exercised as to the materials with which each barrow
was formed, and the way and the shape in which it was built, as
also the arrangement of the charcoal.</p>
<p>Further, perhaps, the different grades of life and relationship
were marked by the presence and position of the urns.
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
Whether this be so or no, it is certain that the mounds here
which contained mortuary vessels were, as a rule, more elevated,
and in nearly all instances placed by themselves. The fact, too,
of the cube-shaped mound with its remains of four urns should
be kept in mind.</p>
<p>Little more can with certainty be said. The flint knives
which have been picked up in the Forest, the stone hammer
in the grave, the clumsy form and make of the urns, the
places, too, of burial&mdash;in the wide furzy Ytene, in after-times
the Bratleys, and Burleys, and Oakleys, of the West-Saxons&mdash;all
show a people whose living was gained rather by hunting
than agriculture or commerce.</p>

<p>From time to time the labourer, in draining or planting in the
Forest, digs down upon pieces of earthenware, whilst in the
turfy spots the mole throws up the black fragments in her
mound of earth. The names, too, of Crockle&mdash;Crock Kiln&mdash;and
Panshard Hill, have from time immemorial marked the site
of at least two potteries. Yet even these had escaped all notice
until Mr. Bartlett, in 1853, gave an account of his excavations,
and showed the large scale on which the Romans carried on
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
their works, and the beauty of their commonest forms and
shapes.<a class="fn" id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a></p>
<p>Since then both Mr. Bartlett and myself have at different
times opened various other sites, and some short notice of their
contents may, perhaps, not be without interest.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, when digging the holes for the gate-posts at
the south-west corner of Anderwood Enclosure, the workmen
discovered some perfect urns and vases. These have, of course,
long since been lost. But as the place was so far distant from
the potteries at Crockle, I determined to re-open it. The site,
however, had been much disturbed. Enough though could be
seen to show that there had once been a small kiln, round which
were scattered for three or four yards, in a black mould of about
a foot and a half in depth, the rims, and handles, and bottoms
of vessels of Romano-British ware. The specimens were entirely
confined to the commonest forms, all ornamentation being
absent, and the ware itself of a very coarse kind, the paste
being grey and gritty.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half off, in Oakley Enclosure, close to the
Bound Beech, I was, however, more fortunate. Here the kiln
was perfect. It was circular, and measured six yards in circumference,
its shape being well-defined by small hand-formed
masses of red brick-earth. The floor, about two feet below
the natural surface of the ground, was paved with a layer of
sand-stones, some of them cut into a circular shape, so as to
fit the kiln, the upper surfaces being tooled, whilst the under
remained in their original state. As at Anderwood, the ware
was broken into small fragments, and was scattered round the
kiln for five or six yards. The specimens were here, too, of
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
the coarsest kind, principally pieces of bowls and shallow dishes,
and, perhaps, though of a different age, not so unlike as might
at first sight be supposed to the</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sympuvium Num&aelig;, nigrumque catinum,</p>
<p class="t0">Et Vaticano fragiles de monte patell&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These appear to be the only kilns which, perhaps from the
unfitness of the clay, were worked in this part of the Forest,
and were used only in manufacturing the most necessary utensils
in daily life.</p>
<p>Of far greater extent are the works at Sloden, covering
several acres. All that remains of these, too, are, I am sorry
to say, mere fragments of a coarse black earthenware. And
although I opened the ground at various points, I never could
meet with anything perfect. Yet the spot is not without great
interest. The character and nature of the south-western slope
exactly coincide with Colt Hoare&rsquo;s description of Knook Down
and the Stockton Works.<a class="fn" id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a> Here are the same irregularities in
the ground, the same black mould, the same coarse pottery, the
same banks, and mounds, and entrenchments, all indicating
the settlement of a Romano-British population. Half-way down
the hill, not far from two large mounds marking the sites of
kilns, stretch trenches and banks showing the spaces within
which, perhaps, the potters&rsquo; huts stood, or where the cultivated
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
fields lay, whilst at one place five banks meet in a point, and
between two of them appear some slight traces of what may have been a
road.<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a></p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, but more to the south-westward,
stands the Lower Hat, where the same coarse ware covers the
earth, and where the presence of nettles and chickweed shows
that the place has once been inhabited.</p>
<p>The Crockle and Island Thorn potteries lie about a mile to
the north-east. At Crockle there were, before Mr. Bartlett opened
them, three mounds, varying in circumference from one hundred
and eighty to seventy yards, each, as I have ascertained, containing
at least three or four, but probably more, kilns. As
the lowest part of the smallest and easternmost mound had
not been entirely explored, I determined to open this piece.
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
Beginning at the extremity, we soon came upon a kiln, which,
like the others discovered by Mr. Bartlett, only showed its
presence by the crumbling red brick earth. An enormous old
oak-stump had grown close beside it, and around the bole were
heaped the drinking-vessels and oil-flasks, which its now rotten
roots had once pierced.</p>

<p class="pcap">Necks of Wine-Vessels and Oil-Flask.</p>
</div>
<p>Nothing could better show, as the excavation proceeded,
the former state of the works. Here were imbedded in the
stiff yellow putty-like clay, of which they were made, masses
of earthenware, the charcoal, with which they were fired, still
sticking to their sides&mdash;pieces of vitreous-looking slag, and
a grey line of cinders mixed with the red brick earth of the
kiln. The ware remained just as it was cast aside by the
potter. You might tell by the bulging of the sides, and the
bright metallic glaze of the vessels, how the workman had overheated
the kiln;&mdash;see, too, by the crookedness of the lines,
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
where his hand had missed its stroke. All was here. The
potter&rsquo;s finger-marks were still stamped upon the bricks. Here
lay the brass coin which he had dropped, and the tool he had
forgotten, and the plank upon which he had tempered the clay.<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The Island Thorn potteries had been so thoroughly opened
by Mr. Bartlett, that I there made but little further explorations,
and must refer my readers to his account,<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a> only here adding
that the ware scarcely differed, except in shape and patterns,
from that at Crockle.</p>
<p>About a mile westward stands Pitt&rsquo;s Enclosure, where in
three different places rise low mounds, two of which, since
the publication of his account, have been opened by Mr. Bartlett,
but from which he only obtained fragments.</p>
<p>The third, which I explored in 1862, was remarkable for
the number of kilns placed close together, separated from each
other only by mounds of the natural soil. In all, there were
five, ranged in a semicircle, and paved with irregular masses
of sandstone. They appear to have been used at the time at
which they were left for firing different sorts of ware. Close
to the westernmost kiln, we found only the necks of various
unguent bottles, whilst the easternmost oven seems to have
been employed in baking only a coarse red panchion, on which
a cover (<i>operculum</i>), with a slight knob for a handle, fitted.
Of these last we discovered an enormous quantity, apparently
flung away into a deep hole.</p>
<p>Near the central kilns we found one or two new shapes and
patterns, but they were, I am sorry to say, very much broken,
the ware not being equal in strength or fineness to that at
Crockle. The most interesting discovery, however, were two
distinct heaps of white and fawn-coloured clay and red earth,
placed ready for mixing, and a third of the two worked together,
fit for the immediate use of the potter.</p>
<p>Near to these works stretch, on a smaller scale, the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
embankments which mark the Sloden potteries. One is particularly
noticeable, measuring twenty-two feet in width, and running
in the shape of the letter Z. In the central portion I cut
two trenches, but could discover nothing but a circle of charcoal,
looking as if it was the remains of a workman&rsquo;s fire, placed on
the level of the natural soil. Another trench I opened at the
extreme end, as also various pits near the embankment, but
failed to find anything further.</p>
<p>At Ashley Rails, also, close by, stand two more mounds,
which cover the remains of more ware. These I only very partially
opened, for the black mould was very shallow, and the
specimens the same as I had found in Pitt&rsquo;s Wood.</p>
<p>Besides these, there are, as mentioned in the last chapter,
extensive works at Black Heath Meadow at the west-end of Linwood,
but they are entirely, like those in Sloden, Oakley, and
Anderwood, confined to the manufacture of coarse Romano-British
pottery. This last ware seems to differ very little in
character or form. The same shapes of jars (copied from the
Roman <i>lagen&aelig;</i>) were found by Mr. Kell near Barnes Chine in
the Isle of Wight,<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a> though at Black Heath, as in the other
places in the Forest, handles, through which cords were probably
intended to pass, with flat dishes, and saucer-like vessels (shaped
similar to <i>pater&aelig;</i>), all, however, in fragments, occurred.<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Such is a brief account of the potteries in the Forest. Their
extent was, with two exceptions, restricted to one district, where
the Lower Bagshot Sands, with their clays, crop out, and to the
very same bed which the potters at Alderholt, on the other side
of the Avon, still at this hour work.</p>
<p>The two exceptions at Oakley and Anderwood are situated
just at the junction of the Upper Bagshot Sands and the Barton
Clays, which did not suit so well, and where the potteries are
very much smaller, and the ware coarser and grittier.</p>
<p>The date of the Crockle potteries may be roughly guessed by
the coins, found there by Mr. Bartlett, of Victorinus.<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a> These
were much worn, and, as Mr. Akerman suggests, might be lost
about the end of the third century; but the potteries were
probably worked till or even after the Romans abandoned the
island.</p>
<p>There is nothing to indicate any sudden removal, but, on the
contrary, everything shows that the works were by degrees
stopped, and the population gradually withdrew. None of the
vessels are quite perfect, but are what are technically known as
&ldquo;wasters.&rdquo; The most complete have some slight flaw, and are
evidently the refuse, which the potter did not think fit for the
market.</p>
<p>The size of the works need excite no surprise, when we
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
remember how much earthenware was used in daily life by the
Romans&mdash;for their floors, and drinking-cups, and oil and wine
flasks, and unguent vessels, and cinerary urns, and boxes for
money. The beauty, however, of the forms, even if it does not
approach that of the Upchurch and Castor pottery, should be
noticed. The flowing lines, the scroll-work patterns, the narrow
necks of the wine-flasks and unguent vessels, all show how well
the true artist understands that it is the real perfection of Art
to make beauty ever the handmaid of use.</p>

<p class="pcap">Patterns from Fragments.</p>
</div>
<p>Another thing, too, is worthy of notice, that the artist was
evidently unfettered by any given pattern or rule. Whatever
device or form was at the moment uppermost in his mind, that
he carried out, his hand following the bent of his fancy. Hence
the endless variety of patterns and forms. No two vessels are
exactly alike. In modern manufactures, however, the smooth
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
uniformity of ugliness most admirably keeps down any symptoms
of the prodigal luxuriance of beauty.<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a></p>
<p>We must, however, carefully beware of founding any theory,
from the existence of these potteries, that the Forest must therefore
have been cultivated in the days of the Conqueror. The
reason why the Romans chose the Forest is obvious,&mdash;not from
its fertility, but because it supplied the wood to fire the kilns;
the same cause which, centuries after, made Yarranton select
Ringwood for his smelting-furnaces. We must, too, bear in
mind that after the Romans abandoned the island the natives
soon went back to their primitive state of semi-barbarism;
and further, that the interval between the Roman occupation
and the Norman Conquest was nearly as great as that
between ourselves and the Conqueror&mdash;a period long enough
for the Kelts, and West-Saxons, and Danes to have swept away
in their feuds all traces of civilization.</p>
<p>But what we should see in them is that beauty of form,
which in simple outline has seldom been excelled, proclaiming
a people who should in their descendants be the future masters
of Art, as then they were of warfare.</p>
<p>The history of a nation may be more plainly read by
its manufactures than by its laws or constitution. Its true
&aelig;sthetic life, too, should be determined not so much by its list
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
of poets or painters, as by the beauty of the articles in
daily use.</p>
<p>And so still at Alderholt, not many miles off, the same beds of
clay are worked, and jars, and flasks, and dishes made, but with
a difference which may, perhaps, enable us to understand our
inferiority in Art to the former rulers of our island.</p>
<p>What further we should see in the whole district, is the way
in which the Romans stamped their iron rule upon every land
which they conquered. Everywhere in the Forest remain their
traces. Urns, made at these potteries, full of their coins, have
been dug up at Anderwood and Canterton. Nails at Cadenham,
millstones at Studley Head, bricks at Bentley, iron slag at
Sloden, with the long range of embankments stretching from
wood to wood, and the camps at Buckland Rings and Eyeworth,
show that they well knew both how to conquer in war and to
rule in peace.</p>

<p>As the monasteries of former days preserved the general records
of the times, so, in a minor degree, do our churches preserve
the special history of our villages. In the social life of the past
our Church Books are the counterpart of our Corporation Books,
performing quite as much for their own parishes as the latter
for their boroughs; not only giving, in the register, a yearly
census of the population, but by the Churchwardens&rsquo; Accounts
the social and religious life of each period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Added to this also the clergyman, having nowhere else
to chronicle them, has often entered in his register the passing
events of the day; so that this further possesses, at times, a
wider historical interest than could have been expected, giving
us often glimpses of the views of men, who, however unsympathetic
with the changes and fortunes of the hour, still carry, from
their office and position, some not inconsiderable weight.</p>
<p>All these books are far too seldom consulted. The few notes
we shall make are by no means given as examples of what may
be elsewhere found, but must be looked upon only as extracts
from the books of a district, where we naturally could expect
little of any general interest.</p>
<p>The New Forest has never been, since registers became the
law of the land, the scene of any of the great events of English
history&mdash;never the theatre of the Civil Wars, as the Midland
Counties, where entries of victories and defeats, and battles and
sieges, are mixed with the burials and births.</p>
<p>Various causes, too, especially the scanty and scattered
population, have contributed to the late date at which nearly all
the Forest registers commence.<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a>
Still, at Eling, there occurs
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
the second earliest parish register in Hampshire, beginning one
year before Cromwell&rsquo;s Act has been passed; showing, as was
before noticed, that this part of the Forest was always the richest,
and, consequently, the most civilized.<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a> In this register we find
the following most interesting entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;1654. Thomas Burges, the sonne of William Burges and
Elizabeth Russel, the daughter of Elizabeth, the now wife of
Stephen Newland, were asked three Sabbath dayes, in the Parish
Church of Eling: sc: Apriel 16th, Ap<sup>r</sup> 23rd, Ap<sup>r</sup> 30th, and were
marr: by Richard L<sup>d</sup> Crumwell, May xxii<sup>d</sup>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need scarcely add that it was under the Protector that an
Act of Parliament was passed in 1653, enabling any persons,
after the due proclamation of the banns in the church or chapel,
or in the market-place, on three market days, to be married by
a simple affirmation before a magistrate; thus in a remarkable
way nearly anticipating modern legislature.<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a> The Protector&rsquo;s
son, at the date of this entry, was probably living at Hursley,
about ten miles away to the north.</p>
<p>Going across to the other side of the Forest, we shall, at
Ellingham, find, in the Churchwardens&rsquo; Books, an entry in a
different way quite as interesting. The leaf is, I am sorry to
say, very much torn, and, towards the lower part, half of it is
wanting. I give, however, the extract as it stands, indicating
the missing passages by the breaks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Martii 13. Anno d&otilde;m. 1634. A special license, granted
by the moste reverende ffather in God, William Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury his Grace, under his Grace&rsquo;s hand and
seale, used in the like grants, dated the nyneteenth day of
ffebruarie, Anno d&otilde;m. 1634, and second yeare of his Grace&rsquo;s
translation. And confirmed by the Letters patents of our
Sov&#772;raigne Lord Charles the King&rsquo;s ma.<sup>tie</sup> that now is ...
Under the Greate Seale of England ffor S<sup>r</sup> White Beconsaw of
this parish and county of South&#772;ton ... (and) Dame

(upon condition of their giving to the) poore of the pi&#772;sh
... Thirteene shillings....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or no the knyght and his lady were to give the
sum yearly, as seems most probable, it is impossible, from the
torn condition of the leaf, to say. Their daughter was the
noble Alice Lisle. The licence, of course, refers to the prohibition
against eating meat on Fridays and Saturdays, and other
specified times, first made by Elizabeth for the encouragement
of the English fisheries, which had even in her reign begun to
decay.<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a> And now that we are on the subject of Churchwardens&rsquo;

<p>Such notices well prove how quick and strong was the
reaction from Protestantism to Catholicism when favoured by
the State. Again, to still further show the variety of entries,
let me make some extracts from the Fordingbridge Churchwardens&rsquo;

<p>These accounts, too, like all others, are full of items for
the repairs of the bells and bell-ropes, confirming what may
be found in the narratives of old French and Italian travellers
concerning our English passion for bell-ringing. The following

<p>The &ldquo;King&rsquo;s day&rdquo; was that on which the King ascended the
throne. Again, to show the mixed and varied contents of the
Churchwardens&rsquo; Books, we will once more go back to those of
Ellingham. Under the date of 1556 we find:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>All these entries, to the church historian, and no less to the
general student, cannot be without peculiar interest. The
smoke silver, which so frequently occurs, is either the money
paid for certain privileges of cutting fuel, which, as we have
seen, was formerly the case in the Forest, or an assessment
on the houses according to the number of hearths, but more
probably the former.<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a> The general reader will scarcely care
for more, but I trust elsewhere to give further extracts from
these most interesting books.</p>
<p>Turning back to the Registers, let me add from the Ibbesley
Parish Register Book, as so few people have seen a specimen,
an entry of an affidavit of burial in a woollen shroud, in compliance
with the Act passed in 1679, for the encouragement of
the woollen manufacture in England.<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a> It thus runs, placed
opposite to the entry of the person&rsquo;s burial, and written in
the same handwriting:&mdash;&ldquo;Jan. 9<sup>th</sup>, 1678/79, I rec<sup>d</sup> a certificate
from Mr. Roger Clavell, Justice of y<sup>e</sup> peace at Brokenhurst,
that Thomas King and Anthony King, sons of Anthony King,
deceased, did make oath before him, the sayd Roger Clavell,
that the aforesayd Antony King was buried according to the
late Act of Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>And again, opposite to the entries of their deaths, we find&mdash;&ldquo;November
11<sup>th</sup>.&mdash;Certified by John Torbuck, Vicar of Ellingham,
y<sup>t</sup> Edward Baily and Nicholas Baily, of Ibsely, were
buried in woollen only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s lines on Mrs. Oldfield need hardly here be quoted.
To conclude, of the parish books in the district let me only say
that at Fordingbridge may be found an inventory of all the
church furniture for 1554; and at Ibbesley, lists of collections
&ldquo;towards the redemption of the poor slaves out of Turkey,&rdquo;
&ldquo;for the poor French Protestants,&rdquo; &ldquo;for the redemption of
captives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;for the distressed Protestants beyond the sea,&rdquo;&mdash;all
testifying to the social and moral condition of the people,
without which it is impossible to give the history of any district
or any country.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, whenever there was an opportunity, to point
out the natural history of the Forest, feeling sure that, from a
lack of this knowledge, so many miss the real charms of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
country. &ldquo;One green field is like another green field,&rdquo; cried
Johnson. Nothing can be so untrue. No two fields are ever
the same. A brook flowing through the one, a narrow strip
of chalk intersecting the other, will make them as different
as Perthshire from Essex. Even Socrates could say in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i>,
&tau;&#8048; &mu;&#8050;&nu; &omicron;&#8022;&nu;
&chi;&omega;&rho;&#8055;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &tau;&#8048;

&mu;&rsquo;
&#7952;&theta;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;
&delta;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;.
and this arose from the state, or rather absence,
of all Natural Science at Athens. Had that been different he
would have spoken otherwise.</p>
<p>The world is another place to the man who knows, and to the
man who is ignorant of Natural History. To the one the earth
is full of a thousand significations, to the other meaningless.</p>
<p>First of all, then, for a few words on the geology of the
Forest; for upon this everything depends&mdash;not only the
scenery, but its Flora and Fauna, the growth of its trees and
the course of its streams. Throughout it is composed of the
Middle-Eocene, the Osborne and Headon Beds capping the
central portion, with their fluvio-marine formation. The Upper
Bagshot develops itself below them, and is succeeded by the
Barton Clays, so well exposed on the coast, and finally by the
Bracklesham Beds, which crop out in the valley of Canterton,
trending in a south-easterly direction to Dibden.</p>
<p>Here, then, where the New Forest stands, in the Eocene
period, rolled an inland sea, whose waves lashed the Wiltshire
chalk hills on the north, moulding, with every stroke of
their breakers, its chalk flints into pebbles, dashing them against
its cliffs, as the waves do at this very hour those very same
pebbles along the Hurst beach. Its south-western boundary-line
between Ballard Head and the Needles was rent asunder by
volcanic action, and the chalk-flints flung up vertically mark to
this day the violence of the disruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Long after this the Isle of Wight was altogether separated
by the Solent from the mainland, but still ages before the historic
period. The various traditions, as to the former depth of the
channel, how Sir Bevis, of Southampton, waded across it, how,
too, the carts brought the Binstead stone for building Beaulieu
Abbey over the dry bed at low water, have been previously
given. The passage, too, in Diodorus Siculus has been already
examined,<a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a> and there can be no doubt, notwithstanding his also
making it, like the traditions, a peninsula at low water, that his
Ictis is the Isle of Wight and not St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount. The
mere local evidence of the mass of tin, the British road&mdash;more
like a deep trench than a road&mdash;still plainly traceable across
the Forest, the names along it corresponding with that of its
continuation in the Island, would alone, most assuredly, show
that this was the place whence the first traders, and, in after-times,
the Romans, exported their tin. We must, however,
remember that the channel of the Solent was caused by depression
rather than by excavation; and that at this moment
an alteration in the levels, as noticed by Mr. Austen,<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a> is going
on eastward of Hurst Castle.</p>
<p>The drift, which spreads over the whole of the New Forest, is
not very interesting. No elephants&rsquo; tusks, or elks&rsquo; horns, so far
as I know, have ever been discovered. A few species of <i>Terebratula</i>
and <i>Pecten</i>, some flint knives, and the <i>os inominatum</i>, of
probably <i>Bos longifrons</i>, mentioned farther on, are the only
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
things at present found. Still, in one way, it is most interesting,
as completely disproving the Chroniclers&rsquo; accounts that,
before its afforestation by the Conqueror, the district of the Forest
was so fertile. The fact is a sheer impossibility. No wheat
could ever be grown on this great bed of chalk-gravel, which is
varied only by patches of sand.</p>
<p>But nowhere, perhaps, in the world can we see the stratification
of the upper portion of the Middle-Eocene better
than at Hordle and Barton, as the sea serves to keep the
different strata exposed. The beds dip easterly with a fall
of about one in a hundred, though, at the extreme west, at
High Cliff, it is much less, and here and there in some few
places they lie almost horizontally.<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a> At Hordle they seem
to have been deposited in a river of a very uniform depth.
There is but one single fault in the whole series, just under
Mead End, where all the beds have alike suffered. Here and
there, however, they are deposited with an undulating line;
and here and there, too, a rippled surface occurs, caused by the
action of small waves. The river appears to have varied very
much in the amount and force of its stream, as some of the beds,
where the shells are less frequent, have been deposited very
rapidly, whilst others, where the organic remains are more
abundant, have been laid on very slowly and in very still water.<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a></p>
<p>It will be impossible to examine all the beds. One or two,
however, may be mentioned. And since the beds rise at the
east we will begin from Milford. First of all, at Mineway, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
runs a remarkable band of fine sand, the &ldquo;Middle Marine Bed,&rdquo;
discovered some twenty-five years ago, by Mr. Edwards, and
subsequently successfully worked by Mr. Higgins. It is seldom,
however, exposed for more than a few yards; but that is sufficient
to show, that after the elevation of the beds beneath they once
more subsided, and the sea came over them again, and after that
they were once again elevated.</p>
<p>Just below Hordle House rises the &ldquo;Crocodile Bed,&rdquo; running
out of the cliff about three hundred yards from Beckton
Bunny. The lowest part of it teems with fish-scales, teeth,
crocodile plates, ophidian vertebr&aelig;, seed vessels, and other
vegetable matter, very often mixed in a coprolitic bed, just
beneath a band of tough clay, the specimens being more frequent
to the east than the west. The accompanying section (I.) will,
perhaps, not only serve to show the situation of the bed, but
also those above and below. My measurements will be found
to differ slightly from Sir Charles Lyell&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_269" href="#fn_269">[269]</a> and Dr. Wright&rsquo;s;<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a>
but this is owing to their having been taken in different places.</p>
<p>Immediately under the &ldquo;Leaf Bed,&rdquo; which, as seen in the
opposite section, rises from the shore to the west of Hordle
House, comes the lowest bed of the Lower Freshwater Series,
formed of blue sandy clay sixteen feet in thickness, from whence
Mr. Falconer obtained so many of his mammalian remains.<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a></p>

<p>It is a bed, however, which is seldom open, and can be
worked only at particular tides. It may easily be recognized as
lying between the Leaf Bed and the well-marked Lignite Bed,
which shows the first traces of salt-water, and where, in the
lower portion, <i>Neritina concava</i> may be abundantly found. This
last bed may be well seen at Beckton Bunny (<span class="sc">Section II.</span>). The
lignite, however, though it will give a good deal of heat, will not
blaze. Locally it is sometimes used for making black paint.</p>

<dt>The present sea-shore.</dt></dl>
<p>Passing on to Beckton Bunny we reach the first true bed
of the Lower Marine Formation, which rises a little eastward of
that ravine. I have distinguished it as the Olive Bed, from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
abundance of specimens of <i>Oliva Branderi</i>, forming the
equivalent to number eighteen in Dr. Wright&rsquo;s arrangement,
and which, when worked, emits a strong smell of sulphur.</p>
<p>Immediately under the Olive Bed, as seen in the opposite
section (II.), taken immediately on the west side of the Bunny,
rises grey sand, seventeen feet and a half in thickness, possessing
only a few casts of shells. The next bed, however, composed
also of grey sand, rising about three hundred yards farther on,
is, perhaps, the richest in the whole of this Marine series, and
its shells the best preserved. It may at once be recognized
by the profusion of <i>Chama squamosa</i>, from which it has been
called the Chama Bed. Specimens of <i>Arca Branderi</i> and <i>Solen
gracilis</i> may be found here as perfect as on the day they were
deposited.</p>
<p>A little farther on, nearly under the Gangway, rises the
Barton clay, encrusted with <i>Crassatella sulcata</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_272" href="#fn_272">[272]</a> And here,
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
on looking at the cliff, we may notice how all the beds, as
they rise westward, gradually lose their clayey character, and
run into sand, which will account for this part of the cliff
foundering so fast. The water percolates through the sand
down to the Barton Beds, and the loose mass above is thus
launched into the sea.</p>
<p>Below the Barton Coastguard Station rises another bed of
green clay, containing sharks&rsquo; teeth and the bones of fish.
About a mile farther on, the High Cliff Beds emerge rich with
<i>Cassis ambigua</i> and <i>Cassidaria nodosa</i>. And below them,
seen in the channel of the stream flowing through Chewton
Bunny, rises a bed of bright metallic-looking, green clay, the
<i>Nummulina Prestwichiana</i> Bed of Mr. Fisher, containing sharks&rsquo;
teeth and some few shells. Beyond, a little to the west of High
Cliff Castle, occurs the well-marked Pebble Bed, the commencement
of the Bracklesham Series, containing rolled chalk flints,
and casts of shells. Next follow grey sands full of fossil
wood and vegetable matter, marked by a course of oxydized
ironstone-septaria. Then succeeds another Pebble Bed, and
lastly appear the grey Bracklesham Sands.<a class="fn" id="fr_273" href="#fn_273">[273]</a></p>
<p>We have thus gone through the principal beds, both of the
Freshwater and Marine Series, as far as they are exposed in this
section along the sea-coast. The fluvio-marine beds stretch away
eastward as far as Beaulieu and Hythe, but their clays here contain
very few shells. On the other hand, the Bracklesham Beds
trend away northward towards Stoney-Cross, appearing in the
valley, and cropping out again on the other side of the
Southampton Water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Some few words must be said about them. The highest
beds, known as the Hunting Bridge Beds, occur in Copse
St. Leonards, not far from the Fritham Road.<a class="fn" id="fr_274" href="#fn_274">[274]</a> In a descending
order, separated by thirty or forty feet of unfossiliferous
clays, come the Shepherd&rsquo;s Gutter Beds, to be found about
half a mile lower down the King&rsquo;s Gairn Brook; and below
them, again, separated by forty or fifty feet of unfossiliferous
clays, and situated somewhat more than a mile lower down the
same stream, rise the Brook Beds. Still farther down, too,
from some shells very lately discovered at Cadenham, it is supposed
that the <i>Cerithium</i> Bed of Stubbington and Bracklesham
Bay will be found, but this is not yet ascertained.</p>
<p>The Hunting Bridge Beds I have never examined, but
subjoin their measurements, as also their most typical shells,<a class="fn" id="fr_275" href="#fn_275">[275]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
and must here content myself to give a general description of
the Shepherd&rsquo;s Gutter and Brook Beds. The former, the
equivalent to the <i>Nummulina</i> Bed at Stubbington, Bracklesham,
and White-Cliff Bay, is so called from a small stream at the
foot of Bramble Hill Wood, about a mile due north of the
King&rsquo;s Gairn Brook. The measurements are as follows:&mdash;(1)
Gravel from one to five feet; (2) light-coloured clay, with
a few fossils sparingly distributed, five to six feet; (3) <i>Turritella
carinifera</i> bed, one foot and a half; (4) fossil bed, characterized
by <i>Conus deperditus</i>, and the abundance of <i>Pecten
corneus</i> within a few inches of the bottom, one foot and a half.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>It is worth noticing that these, like all the Bracklesham
beds, roll. In a pit which Mr. Keeping and myself dug we
found there had been a regular displacement of the gravel, and
that the beds rose at an angle of thirty degrees, whilst the
fossil bed was three feet lower on one side than the other of
the pit. In another, after cutting through a foot of gravel, in
which we found the <i>os inominatum</i>, of probably <i>Bos longifrons</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_276" href="#fn_276">[276]</a>
and a bed of sandy clay about two feet in thickness, we came
upon a deposit of gravel about four inches thick, lying in the
depressions of the stiff brown clay which succeeded, and in
which still remained roots and vegetable matter. Thus we can
plainly see that, after the clay had been deposited, vegetable,
and perhaps animal, life flourished. Then came the gravel,
carrying all before it, and in its turn, too, was nearly swept
away, and only left here and there in a few scattered patches.</p>
<p>Perhaps, nothing is so startling as this insecurity of life.
As was the Past so will be the Future, guided, though, always
by that Law, which at every step still rises, moving in no circle,
but out of ruin bringing order, and from Death, Life.</p>
<p>The Brook Beds I can best describe for the general reader
by an account of a pit which Mr. Keeping and myself made.
It was sunk about 20 feet from the King&rsquo;s Gairn Brook, and
measured about 6 yards long by 4 broad. We first cut through
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
a loamy sand, measuring 3 feet, and then came upon 19 inches
of gravel, where at the base stretched the half fossilized trunk
of an oak, and a thick drift of leaves mixed with black peaty
matter, the remains of some prim&aelig;val forest. Three feet of
light-coloured clay, unfossiliferous, succeeded; and then came
the <i>Corbula</i> Bed, with its myriads of <i>Corbula pisum</i>, massed
together, nearly all pierced by their enemies, the <i>Murices</i>. Stiff
light-coloured clay, measuring 18 inches, followed, revealing
some of the shells, which were to be found so plentiful in the
next stratum. Here, at the <i>Pleurotoma attenuata</i> Bed, our
harvest commenced, and since Mr. Keeping has worked these
beds, no spot has ever yielded such rich results. Every stroke
of the pick showed the pearl and opal-shaded colours of the
nautilus, and the rich chestnut glaze of the <i>Pecten corneus</i>,
whilst at the bottom lay the great thick-shelled <i>Cardit&aelig; planicost&aelig;</i>.
Inside one of these were enclosed two most lovely
specimens of <i>Calyptr&aelig;a trochiformis</i>. Mr. Keeping here, too,
found a young specimen of <i>Natica cepacea</i> (?), and I had the
good fortune to turn up the largest <i>Pleurotoma attenuata</i> ever
yet discovered, measuring 4&frac12; inches in length, and 3&frac14; inches
in circumference round the thickest whorl.</p>
<p>We were now down no less than 8 feet. And at this stage
the water from the brook, which had been threatening, began
to burst in upon us from the north side. We, however, with
intervals of bailing, still pushed on till we reached the next
bed of pale clay, measuring from 7 to 8 inches, containing
<i>Cassidari&aelig;</i> highly pyritised, and sharks&rsquo; teeth, amongst which
Mr. Keeping discovered an enormous spine, measuring at least
10 inches in length, but we were unable to take it out perfect.
The water had all this time been gaining upon us, in spite of
our continuous efforts to bail it with buckets. We, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
succeeded in making the <i>Voluta horrida</i> bed, which seemed, at
this spot, literally teeming with shells. Each spitful, too,
showed specimens of fruit, earbones, fish-palates, drift-wood,
and those nodular concretions which had gathered round some
berry or coral.<a class="fn" id="fr_277" href="#fn_277">[277]</a></p>
<p>At this point, the water, which was now pouring through the
side in a complete stream, and a rumbling noise, showed danger
was imminent. Hastily picking up our tools and fossils we
retreated. In a moment a mass of clay began to move, and
two or three tons, completely burying our bed, fell where we had
stood. Founder after founder kept succeeding, driving the
water up to higher levels. We procured assistance, but precious
time was lost. Night began to fall, and we were obliged to leave
unworked one of the richest spots which, in these beds, may,
perhaps, ever be met.</p>
<p>As it was, we found no less than sixty-one species, including
in all 230 good cabinet specimens, which, considering the small
size of the pit, and our limited time, and the great disadvantages
under which we worked, well showed the richness of these beds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Merely, however, collecting fossils for collecting&rsquo;s sake is
useless. The aim of geology is to enable us to understand
how this world was made&mdash;how form followed form, how type
after type took life and then passed away, and the higher
organization ever succeeded the lower. The Middle-Eocene
ought to be to us particularly interesting, separating us, on the
one hand, from those monsters which had filled the previous
Age, and, on the other, presenting the first appearances of those
higher mammals which should serve the future wants of man.
The pterodactyle no longer darkened the air. The iguanodon
now slept in its grave of chalk. A new earth, covered with new
types and new forms, had appeared. It is a strange sight which
the Hordle Cliffs unveil. Here, beneath a sun fiercer than
in our tropics, the crocodile basked in its reed beds. Here the
alligator crimsoned the stream, as he struck his jaws into his
victim; whilst the slow tryonyx paddled through the waves, and
laid its eggs on the sand, where its plates are now bedded.</p>
<p>The very rushes, which grew on the river banks, lie caked
together, with the teeth of the rats which harboured in them.
The pine-cones still, too, lie there, their surfaces scarcely more
abraded than when they dropped from the tree into the tepid
waters. Along the muddy river shore browsed the paloplothere,
whilst his mate crashed through the jungle of club-mosses.
Groves of palms stood inland, or fringed the banks, swarming
with land-snakes. Birds waded in the shallows. But no
human voice sounded: nothing was to be heard but the screaming
of the river-fowl, and the deep bellow of the tapir-shaped
pal&aelig;othere, and the wolf-like bark of the hy&aelig;nodon.</p>
<p>This description is no mere fancy, but taken from the
remains actually discovered in the Hordle Cliffs. I have had no
need to borrow from the fossils of the Headon and Binstead
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
Beds, or the caves of Montmartre. On these cliffs, too, is
scored the history of the past. Here lie the little <i>Nucul&aelig;</i>, still
crimson and pink as when they first settled down through the
water into their bed of sand; and teeth of dichodons still bright
with enamel. The struggle of life raged as fiercely then as
now. And the pierced skull of the pal&aelig;othere still tells where
it received its death-wound from its foe the crocodile.</p>
<p>But other things do they reveal. They plainly show, as
was, I believe, first suggested by Mr. Searles Wood, that in
the Middle-Eocene period Europe and America were connected.
The pachyderms of Hordle are allied to the tapirs of the New
World. The same alligators still swim in the warm rivers of
Florida: and the same type of sauroid fish, whose scales
spangle the Freshwater Beds, is now only found in the West.</p>

</div>
<p>Closely connected with the geology of the Forest are its
flowers. And though mere geology could not tell us the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
Flora of a district, yet we might always be able, by its help and
that of the latitude, to give the typical plants. Close to the
chalk, the Forest possesses none of the chalk flowers. No bee-orchis
or its congeners, although so common on all the neighbouring
Wiltshire downs, bloom. No travellers&rsquo;-joy trails
amongst its thickets, although every hedge in Dorsetshire,
just across the Avon, is clothed in the autumn with its
white fleece of seeds. No yellow bird&rsquo;s-nest (<i>Monotropa
Hypopitys</i>) shades itself under its beeches, though growing
only a few miles distant on the chalk.</p>
<p>Still, here there are some contradictions. The chalk-loving
yew appears to be indigenous. Several plants which we might
reasonably expect, as herb-Paris, the bird-nest orchis (<i>Neottia
Nidus-avis</i>), and the common mezereon (<i>Daphne Mezereum</i>),
are wanting.</p>
<p>Owing to the want of stiff clay, no hornbeams grow in its
woods, except, perhaps, a few in one or two cold &ldquo;bottoms.&rdquo;
No Solomon&rsquo;s seal or lilies of the valley whiten its dells. No
meadow-geranium waves its blue flowers on the banks of the
Avon.<a class="fn" id="fr_278" href="#fn_278">[278]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the plants too truly tell the character
of the soil. In the spring the little tormentil shows its bright
blossoms, and the petty-whin grows side by side with the
furze, and the sweet mock-myrtle throws its shadow over the
streams. In the summer and autumn the blue sheep&rsquo;s-bit
scabious and the golden-rod bloom, with the three heathers.
In the bogs the round-leaved sundew is pearled with wet, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
not far from it the cotton-grass waves its white down, and the
asphodel rears its golden spike.</p>
<p>These are the commonest flowers of the Forest, and grow
everywhere over its moors. In its dykes and marshes, the
common frog-bit and the marsh-pimpernel spring up in every
direction. The buckbean, too, brightens every pool on the
south side, and is so common near the Avon that many of the
fields are called &ldquo;the buckbean mead,&rdquo; whilst in the northern
parts it is known as &ldquo;the fringed water-lily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very rich is the Forest in all these bog-plants. In Hinchelsea
and Wilverley Bottoms grow the water-pimpernel
(<i>Samolus Valerandi</i>), the lesser bladder-wort, and the bur-reed
(<i>Sparganium natans</i>) floating on the water. Here, too, perhaps,
the easternmost station known for it, blossoms the butterwort
(<i>Pinguicula Lusitanica</i>), with its pale delicate flowers. In
the autumn, also, the open turf grounds round Wootton are
blue with the Calathian violet (<i>Gentiana Pneumonanthe</i>); whilst
its little bright congener (<i>Cicendia filiformis</i>) blossoms in all
the damp places.</p>
<p>Owing, also, to the presence of iron, the Forest possesses
no less than seventeen or eighteen carices. The little thyme-leaved
flax, too (<i>Radiola millegrana</i>), grows in all the moist,
sandy dells.</p>
<p>From this general view it will be seen that the true Forest
plants are not so much &ldquo;sylvestral&rdquo; as &ldquo;ericetal,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;paludal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;uliginal.&rdquo; Besides these groups, however,
the Flora of the district further divides itself into the &ldquo;littoral
plants&rdquo; along the sea-shores and estuaries, and the &ldquo;pascual&rdquo;
flowers of the valley of the Avon. In the former division,
owing to the want of rocks, no <i>Statice spathulata</i> grows on
its sea-board. No true samphire (<i>Crithmum maritimum</i>)
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
blossoms. The beautiful maiden&rsquo;s-hair fern, once so plentiful
on the neighbouring coast of the Isle of Wight, is also from the
same cause wanting.</p>
<p>Still, great beauty blooms on the Forest streams and shores.
In the latter part of the summer, the mudbanks of the Beaulieu
river are perfectly purple with the sea-aster, whilst the sea-lavender
waves its bright blue crest among the reed-beds washed
over by every tide.</p>
<p>The valley of the Avon is characterized, as may be expected,
by the commoner species, which are to be found in such situations.
Here, and in the adjoining cultivated parts, which once
were more or less a part of the Forest, we find the soap-wort
(<i>Saponaria officinalis</i>) and the thorn-apple (<i>Datura Stramonium</i>),
and those colonists which always harbour close to the
dwellings of man. Other considerations remain. The situation
and climate of the New Forest, of course, have a great effect
on its plants.<a class="fn" id="fr_279" href="#fn_279">[279]</a> The two myrtles and the sweet-bay grow under
the cliffs of Eagleshurst, close to the Solent, unhurt by the
hardest frosts. The grapes ripen on the cottage-walls of Beaulieu
nearly as early as in Devonshire. I have seen the coltsfoot
in full blossom, near Hythe, on the 27th of February; and the
blackthorn flowers at Wootton on the 3rd of April.</p>
<p>The area of the New Forest comes under Watson&rsquo;s Subprovince
of the Mid-Channel, on the Southern belt of his Inferagrarian
zone. Its position lies exactly half-way between his
Germanic and Atlantic types. The former shows itself by
<i>Dianthus Armeria</i>, and <i>Pulicaria vulgaris</i>, growing near Marchwood
and Bisterne. The latter by such examples as <i>Cotyledon</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
<i>umbilicus</i>, <i>Pinguicula Lusitanica</i>, <i>Briza minor</i>, and <i>Agrostis
setacea</i>. The &ldquo;British&rdquo; and &ldquo;English&rdquo; types are, of course,
plentifully represented.<a class="fn" id="fr_280" href="#fn_280">[280]</a></p>
<p>Looking, too, at the trees and shrubs which are indigenous,
we shall find them also eminently characteristic. In spite of
what C&aelig;sar says, the beech is certainly a native, pushing out
in places even the oak. The holly, too, grows everywhere in
massy clumps. In the spring, the wild crab (<i>Pyrus Malus</i>)
crimsons the thickets of Brockenhurst, in the autumn the
maple. The butcher&rsquo;s broom stands at the foot of each beech,
and the ivy twines its great coil round each oak, and the
mistletoe finds its home on the white poplar.</p>
<p>After all, the trees, and not the flowers, give its character to
the New Forest. In the spring, all its woods are dappled with
lights and shades, with the amber of the oak and the delicate soft-gleaming
green of the birch and beech. In the autumn, the
spindle-tree (<i>Euonymus Europ&aelig;us</i>) in the Wootton copses is
hung with its rosy gems; and the trenches of Castle Malwood
are strewed with the silver leaves of the white-beam.</p>
<p>To return, however, to the plants, let us notice how some
particular families seem especially to like the light gravelly soil
of the Forest district. Take, for instance, the St. John&rsquo;s-worts,
of which we have no less than six, if not more varieties. The
common perforated (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>) shines on every
dry heath, and the square-stalked (<i>quadrangulum</i>) in all the
damp boggy places. The tutsan (<i>Andros&aelig;mum</i>) is so common
round Wootton that it is known to all the children as &ldquo;touchen
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
leaves,&rdquo; evidently only a corruption of its name; and its berries
are believed throughout the Forest to be stained with the blood
of the Danes. The rarer large-flowered (<i>calycinum</i>) grows,
though not, I am afraid, truly wild, in some of the thickets
round Sway. In all the ponds, the marsh (<i>elodes</i>) springs
up, whilst the creeping (<i>humifusum</i>) trails its blossoms
over the turf of the Forest lanes, and the small (<i>pulchrum</i>)
shows its orange-tipped flowers amongst the brambles and
bushes.</p>
<p>Take, again, the large family of the ferns, of which seventeen
species are distributed throughout the Forest. First and foremost,
of course, stands the royal fern (<i>Osmunda regalis</i>), which
may be found from the sea-board to Fordingbridge, rearing its
stem in some places six feet high, and covering in patches on
the southern border, as at Beckley, nearly a quarter of an acre.
It grows in Chewton Glen, in all the lanes in the neighbourhood,
on Ashley Common, close to the Osmanby Ford River, and rears
its golden-brown pannicles in the boggy thickets near Rufus&rsquo;s
Stone. But before it, in beauty, stands the lady-fern, with its
delicate fronds and its tender green, growing in the open spaces
of the beech woods, as at Stonehard and Puckpits, and bending
over the Forest streams in large leafy clumps. Then, too, in
all the large woods grows the sweet-scented mountain fern
(<i>Lastrea Oreopteris</i>); and on every bank the hart&rsquo;s-tongue spreads
its broad ribbon-like leaves, and the fertile fronds of the hard-fern
spring up feathery and light, whilst from the old oaks
the common polypody droops with its dark green tresses. The
common maiden-hair (<i>Asplenium Trichomanes</i>), too, hangs on
the walls and Forest banks; and on Alice Lisle&rsquo;s tomb, at
Ellingham, the rue-leaved spleenwort is green throughout the
whole year. On Breamore churchyard wall and Ringwood
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
bridges grows the common scale-fern, whilst in the meadows
of the Avon springs the adder&rsquo;s-tongue&rsquo;s green spear.</p>
<p>Nor must we forget the brake, common though it be, for this
it is which gives the Forest so much of its character, clothing it
with green in the spring; and when the heather is withered, and
the furze, too, decayed, making every holt and hollow golden.<a class="fn" id="fr_281" href="#fn_281">[281]</a></p>
<p>And now for some other plants, without reference to their
species, but simply to their beauty. On Ashley Common and
the neighbouring grass-fields grows the moth-mullein (<i>Verbascum
Blattaria</i>), dropping its yellow flowers, as they one by one
expand. In the neighbouring pools, as far as Wootton, the
blossoms of the great spearwort (<i>Ranunculus Lingua</i>) gleam
among the reeds. There, also, the narrow-leaved lungwort
(<i>Pulmonaria angustifolia</i>), with its leaves both plain and spotted,
opens its blue and crimson flowers so bright, that they are
known to all the children as the &ldquo;snake flower,&rdquo; and gathered
by handfuls mixed with the spotted orchis. And the ladies&rsquo;
tresses, too (<i>Spiranthes autumnalis</i>), shows its delicate brown
braid on every dry field on the southern border.</p>
<p>Besides these, the feathered pink (<i>Dianthus plumarius</i>)
blooms on the cloister-walls at Beaulieu; and the Deptford pink
(<i>Dianthus Armeria</i>) in the valley of the Avon at Hucklebrook,
near Ibbesley. The bastard-balm (<i>Melittis Melissophyllum</i>)
flaunts its white and purple blossoms over the banks of Wootton
plantation, whilst at Oakley and Knyghtwood the red gladiolus
crimsons the green beds of fern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>Briefly, let me say that, as is the Forest soil, so are its
plants. Nature ever makes some compensations. The barrenest
places she ever clothes with beauty. If corn will not grow, she
will give man something better. In the great woods the columbines
and tutsan shine in the spring with their blue and yellow
blossoms, and the wood-sorrel nestles its white flowers among
the mossy roots of the oaks. In the more open spaces the foxgloves
overtop the brake, and in the grassy spots the eyebright
waves its white-grey crest; and not far off are sure to gleam
faint crimson patches of the marsh-pimpernel, half hid in moss;
whilst the swamps are fringed with the coral of the sundew.</p>

<p>To describe the Fauna of the Forest is beyond the purpose of
this book, and would, beside, require a life-time to properly
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
accomplish. I can only here deal with the ornithology as I
have with the botany. I do not know either that the general
reader will lose anything by the treatment. A scientific knowledge
is not so much needed as, first of all, a sympathy with
nature, and a love for all her forms of beauty. The great object
in life is not to know, but to feel. But, before we speak of
the birds, let us correct some errors which are so common with
regard to the animals. It is quite a mistake to talk of wild
boars or wild ponies roaming over the Forest. There is not
now an animal here without an owner. The wild boars introduced
by Charles I., and others brought over some fifty
years ago, are seen only in their tame descendants&mdash;sandy-coloured,
or &ldquo;badger-pied,&rdquo; as they are called, which are turned
out into the Forest during the pannage months.<a class="fn" id="fr_282" href="#fn_282">[282]</a></p>
<p>So, too, the Forest ponies never run wild, except in the
sense of being unbroken. Lath-legged, small-bodied, and
heavy-headed, but strong and hardy, living on nothing in the
winter but the furze, they are commonly said, without the
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
slightest ground, to be descendants of the Spanish horses which
swam ashore from the disabled ships of the Armada.</p>
<p>And now for the ornithology. The thick woods, the lonely
moors and holts, attract the birds of prey; the streams and
marshes the waders; whilst the estuaries of the Beaulieu, and
Lymington, and Christchurch rivers, and the Solent, afford a
shelter in winter to the geese and ducks driven from the north.</p>
<p>Again, too, the peculiar mildness of the climate has its effect
on the birds as well as the plants. The martin and the swallow
come early in March and stay till the end of November; that is
to say, remain full three-quarters of the year. I have heard, too,
the cuckoo as early as April 11th and as late as July the 12th.
The warblers, whose arrival depends so much on the south-east
winds, may not come earlier than in other parts of England.
They certainly, however, in the southern and more cultivated
parts, where food is plentiful, stay here later than in the Midland
Counties; and I have heard the whitethroat singing, as on a
spring day, in the middle of October.</p>
<p>We will begin with the birds of prey. Gilpin (vol. ii. p. 294)
mentions a pair of golden eagles, which, for many years, at
times frequented King&rsquo;s Wood, and a single specimen, killed
near Ashley Lodge. These, however, with the exception of
one shot some twenty years ago over Christchurch Harbour, are
the last instances of a bird, which can now be seldom seen
except in the north of Scotland. Yarrell,<a class="fn" id="fr_283" href="#fn_283">[283]</a> too, notices that the
sea eagle (<i>Aquila albicilla</i>) is sometimes a visitor in the district,
but though I have been down under the Hordle and Barton Cliffs,
day after day, for often six months together, I have never seen a
specimen. It, however, sometimes occurs in the winter, and is
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
mistaken for its rarer ally; and the Eagle Tree at the extreme
west end of Vinney Ridge commemorates where one was shot,
some fifty years ago, by a Forest-keeper. The osprey, however
(<i>Falco hali&aelig;&euml;tus</i>), still frequents the coast in the autumn,
and circles over Christchurch Harbour fishing for his prey,
where, as Yarrell mentions, he is well known as the &ldquo;grey-mullet
hawk,&rdquo; on account of his fondness for that fish.</p>
<p>The Peregrine Falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), which breeds on
the high Culver Cliffs of the Isle of Wight, and in the Lulworth
Rocks, is in the summer a regular visitor, and scours the whole
country. No year goes by without some half-dozen or more
being killed.</p>
<p>Its congener the hobby (<i>Falco subbuteo</i>), known in the Forest
as &ldquo;the van-winged hawk,&rdquo; comes about the same time as the
honey-buzzard, building in the old, deserted nests of crows and
magpies, and even, as in one case, to my knowledge, in that
of the honey-buzzard. The bird, however, is becoming scarce.
For several years I have known a pair or two build in Buckhill
Wood, of which a sketch is given at the end of this chapter,
but last year none came. It lays generally about the beginning
of June, though I have received its eggs as late as July 12th.
Yarrell says that their number is three or four; but, with
Mr. Hoy,<a class="fn" id="fr_284" href="#fn_284">[284]</a> I have never known the bird lay more than three,
and very often only two.</p>
<p>The goshawk (<i>Falco palumbarius</i>) and the rough-legged
buzzard (<i>Falco lagopus</i>) are very rarely seen; but, I fear, the
kite, although so plentiful in Gilpin&rsquo;s time, has nearly deserted
this, like all other districts. Once, and once only, has it been
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
seen by Mr. Farren. The honey-buzzard, however (<i>Falco
apivorus</i>), comes regularly over from Germany about the end
of May, attracted, in some measure, perhaps, by its favourite
food, the larv&aelig; of wasps and bees, but chiefly by the wide range
of the woods. At Mark Ash and Puckpits I have frequently,
for an hour together, watched a couple, sailing with their wings
outspread, allowing the wind, on a boisterous day, to catch
them, till it almost veered them over; just circling round the
tops of the beeches, sometimes even &ldquo;tumbling,&rdquo; like a pigeon,
and answering each other with their sharp, short cry, prolonged
every now and then into a melancholy wail. Its favourite
breeding stations are amongst the tall beech-woods round Lyndhurst,
in Mark Ash, and Gibbs Hill, Puckpits, Coalmeer, Prior&rsquo;s
Acre, and the oaks of Bentley and Sloden. The nest is always
placed in the old one of a crow, or even the common buzzard,
whose young by that time have flown, and sometimes made on
the top of a squirrel&rsquo;s &ldquo;cage,&rdquo; the birds contenting themselves
with only re-shaping it, and lining the inside with fresh green
leaves. The fact of a squirrel&rsquo;s &ldquo;cage&rdquo; being used will account
for the nest being sometimes found so low, and on a comparatively
small tree. No rule can therefore be laid down as to its
position. I have known the bird build in very different situations.
Mr. Rake found its nest in Sloden, on the forked bough
of a low oak, not thirty feet from the ground. In 1860 a pair
built, not very much higher, in the overhanging branch of a
beech in Puckpits; and, in the same year, another pair reared
their young on the top of a fir in Holmy Ridge Hill. And in
1861 and 1862, I knew of two nests, not fifty yards apart, in
Mark Ash, each placed nearly at the top of the very tallest
beeches in the wood, at least seventy or eighty feet from the
ground. As so little appears to be known about its breeding
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
habits, I may as well add a few more words. It seldom arrives
till the beginning of June, when the leaves are thick on the
trees, and immediately commences its nest, for which purpose it
seems only to come, as it immediately departs when the young
birds can fly. Pairs have been known, however, not to lay till
the end of July; and, I am assured by one of the Forest
keepers, not sometimes till even the beginning of August; but
these are, doubtless, cases where the birds have been robbed of
their first eggs. It differs from the common buzzard in not
flying away when disturbed during incubation, but merely
skimming round the top of the tree in small circles, uttering
its short, shrill cry, sometimes both male and female perching
on the branch of a neighbouring tree, and remaining undisturbed
by shouts or cries, whilst the nest is being reached. At these
times a kind of stupidity seizes the bird. It has, to my knowledge,
on several occasions, remained in the nest till a boy has
touched its feathers, and returned as soon as he left.</p>
<p>As a further illustration, I may add, that in one of the nests
before mentioned, in Mark Ash (June 7th, 1862), was only one
egg, which was taken. The birds, however, did not forsake,
and another, which was also taken, was laid on the third day.
Even then the birds did not desert, but after the interval of two
more days laid a third egg, about one-half smaller than usual,
and in shape somewhat resembling a peregrine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On another occasion, June 11th, 1859, a pair bred in a high
beech in Coalmeer Wood, near Stoney Cross, and though fired at
more than once did not desert. The female, however, was first
shot, when the cock, nothing daunted, took his partner&rsquo;s place,
and sat on the eggs, and in a day or two afterwards shared her
fate. In the nest were two eggs, which, with the exception
before mentioned, I have never known exceeded. Those in my
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
collection vary in colouring from the light dull vermilion, which
so often characterizes the merlin&rsquo;s eggs, to a deep rich morone,
tinted, especially in newly-taken specimens, with a delicate
crimson bloom.<a class="fn" id="fr_285" href="#fn_285">[285]</a></p>
<p>A few words more. The birds are not much seen in the
day, but generally early in the morning. Whilst the hen bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
sits on the eggs, the cock perches close by in some tall thick
tree. Perhaps from this very affection for their young arises
their seeming stupidity, and the ease with which they are killed.
Some years ago a keeper found a nest with two young birds in
Bentley Wood, and on purpose to secure them tied them by
their legs to a small tree, where the old birds regularly came
and fed them. But the strangest fact with regard to their
breeding is that before they finally decide upon a nest they will
line several with green leaves and small leafy twigs. Lastly,
I may add that though I have examined many nests, I have
never found any traces of their being, as is related by some
writers, lined with wool. If there was any wool it was probably
placed there by the bird which had previously inhabited the nest.</p>
<p>The common buzzard (<i>Falco buteo</i>) is a resident all through
the year in the Forest, and may now and then be seen towering
high up in the air, so high that you would not at first notice
him, unless you heard his wild scream. It is not, however,
nearly so plentiful as formerly. He is a sad coward, and the
common crow will not only attack, but defeat him. Once or
twice I have seen their battles during the breeding season.
The jays, and magpies, too, and even the pewits, will mob him,
the latter striking at him almost like a falcon. Its favourite
breeding-places are in the Denny and Bratley Woods, Sloden,
Birchen Hat, Mark Ash, and Prior&rsquo;s Acre. Several nests
are yearly taken, for the bird generally breeds when the bark-strippers
are at work in April and May. A series of its eggs,
in my collection, taken in the Forest, show every variety of
colouring from nearly pure white to richly blotched specimens.</p>
<p>In the breeding-season the birds are excessively destructive.
A boy who climbed up to a nest in the spring of 1860
told me that he found no less than two young rabbits, a grey
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
hen, and two thrushes as provision for two nestlings. However,
there is always some compensation, for in one which I examined
were the skeletons of two snakes and a rat picked to the bone.</p>

<p class="pcap">Honey-Buzzard&rsquo;s Nest.</p>
</div>
<p>The accompanying vignette will, I trust, although the nests
are so exactly alike, be of some interest. Whilst the artist
was sketching the honey-buzzard&rsquo;s nest, the old bird, the first
which I had noticed in 1862, made its appearance and circled
round the tree, uttering its peculiar short shrill squeak. This
nest, which had been repaired in the previous year, the dead
beech-leaves still hanging on to the twigs, was between forty
and fifty feet from the ground; whilst that of the common
buzzard, who, whilst sitting, had, a month before, been killed,
was upwards of seventy feet, and placed on the very topmost
boughs of a beech, on which tree was also the other.</p>
<p>But more important than even the nesting of the honey-buzzard
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
is that of the merlin (<i>Falco &aelig;salon</i>), which fact has
never yet been, so far as I know, noticed as occurring in the
New Forest. In the winter this little hawk is sometimes seen
hunting, as it does in Ireland, the snipe, although but few
specimens find their way to the bird-stuffer. It lingers on,
however, to the summer, but the opportunities then of watching
its habits are more rare, as the foliage of the woods is so thick.
In 1859 and 1861 Mr. Farren received two nests with three
eggs, taken in old pollard hollies growing in the open heath,
which in every way corresponded with those of the merlin,
being considerably smaller than those of kestrels. Unfortunately,
however, he could not procure the parent birds, and
the fact of the merlin&rsquo;s nesting remained doubtful. In 1862
he was at last successful, and on May 22nd discovered a nest,
placed in the hole of a yew, also containing, like the others,
three eggs, from which the male bird was shot. Both the bird
and eggs are now in my collection, the latter being somewhat
richer and darker in colour than those which I have received
from the Orkney and Shetland islands. The important fact,
however, to be noticed is that, as Temminck remarks, the birds
in a woody country build in trees, whilst in the north of Britain,
where there is no timber, they adapt themselves to the country,
and lay on the ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_286" href="#fn_286">[286]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>The marsh and hen-harriers, too, frequent the moors and
heaths of the Forest, especially the latter, locally known as the
&ldquo;blue hawks.&rdquo; Some few pairs of these breed here, and in
1859 a nest containing three young birds was found near Picket
Post by a woodman, and another in 1862, with three eggs, on
Beaulieu Heath. One of the Forest keepers described the fern
for some distance round a nest, which he discovered, as completely
trodden down by the young birds, and so littered with
feathers and dirt that, to use his words, the place had
exactly the appearance of a goose-pen. A woodman, too, who
in 1860 was set to watch a pair near Ocknell, gave me an
interesting account of his seeing the old birds breaking off
the young tops of the fern to form their nest. I have never
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
myself been fortunate enough in the Forest to find their
nest, but I have often watched a pair on Black Knoll and
Beaulieu Heath skimming over the ground, pausing to hover
just above the furze, then flying forward for some ten or twenty
yards, turning themselves suddenly sideways; and then again,
for a minute, poising, kestrel-like, beating each bush, and
every now and then going up a little higher in the air, but
quickly coming down close over the cover.</p>
<p>Passing from the falcons, let us look at the owls, of which
the Forest possesses four, if not more, varieties. The commonest
is the tawny (<i>Strix aluco</i>), whose hooting fills the woods
all through the winter. At Stoney Cross I have repeatedly
heard, on a still November night, a pair of them calling to one
another at least two miles apart. It not only breeds in holes
of trees, but in old crows&rsquo;-nests, and will often, when its eggs
are taken, lay again within a week. The barn owl, strange
to say, is not much more abundant than the long-eared (<i>Strix
otus</i>), which breeds in the old holly-bushes, generally taking
some magpie&rsquo;s nest, where it lays three eggs. Rarer still is
the short-eared (<i>Strix brachyotus</i>), which visits the Forest in
November, staying through the winter, and in the day-time
rising out of the dry heath and withered fern.<a class="fn" id="fr_287" href="#fn_287">[287]</a></p>
<p>Leaving the owls, let us notice some of the other birds.
Many a time, in the cold days of March, have I seen the woodcocks,
in the new oak plantations of Wootton, carrying their
young under their wing, clutching them up in their large claws.
Here, on the ground, they lay their eggs, which are of the
same colour as the withered oak-leaves&mdash;a dull ochre, spotted
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
and clouded with brown, and are thus easily overlooked. About
the same time, or even earlier&mdash;in February&mdash;the raven will
build, or rather used to, in the old woods round Burley. In
1858 the two last nests were taken, the eggs being somewhat
smaller than those which I have received from the Orkneys.
Another of its breeding stations was in Puckpits, where, however,
it has not built for the last four seasons. Formerly the
bird was common enough, as the different Ravensnest Woods
still show; and old men in the Forest have told me, in direct
opposition, however, to what Yarrell says,<a class="fn" id="fr_288" href="#fn_288">[288]</a> that when, as boys,
taking its eggs, they were obliged to arm themselves with stones
and sticks to drive off the parent birds, who fiercely defended
their nests with their claws and bills. Now it is nearly extinct,
though a pair may sometimes be seen wherever there is a dead
horse or cow in the district.</p>
<p>Then, when the summer comes, and the woods are green and
dark, the honey-buzzard skims round the tops of the trees; and
the snipe, whose young have not yet left the swamps, goes
circling high up in the air, &ldquo;bleating,&rdquo; as the common people
here call the noise of its wings, each time it descends in its
waving, wandering flight; whilst out on the open spaces the
whinchat, known throughout the Forest, from its cry, as the
&ldquo;furze hacker,&rdquo; jerks itself from one furze branch to another;
and flitting along with it fly a pair of Dartford warblers.</p>
<p>And as, too, evening draws down, from the young green fern
the goatsucker, the &ldquo;night-crow&rdquo; and the &ldquo;night-hawk&rdquo; of the
district, springs up under your feet, and settles a few yards off,
and then flies a little way farther, hoping to lead you from its
white marble-veined eggs on the bare ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Such scenes can the Forest show to the ornithologist in
spring and summer, nor is it less interesting to him in the
winter. Here, as he wanders across some moor, flocks of fieldfares
and missel-thrushes start out of the hollies, and the ring-ousel
skulks off from the yew. A bittern, its neck encircled
with a brown frill of feathers, is, perhaps, wading by the stream;
and hark! from out of the sky comes the clanging of a wedge-shaped
flock of grey-lag geese.</p>
<p>Instead of a chapter a volume might be written upon the
ornithology of the New Forest, especially about the winter
visitants&mdash;the flocks of pochards, and teal, and tufted-ducks,
which darken the Avon, and the swans and geese which whiten
the Solent. I have stood for hours on the beach at Calshot, and
watched the faint cloud in the horizon gradually change into a
mass of wings beating with one stroke, or marked string after
string of wigeon come splashing down in the mid-channel.
Little flocks of ring-dotterels and dunlins flit overhead, their
white breasts flashing in the winter sun every time they wheeled
round. The shag flies heavily along, close to the water, with
his long outstretched neck, melancholy and slow, and the cry
of the kittiwake sounds from the mud-flats.</p>
<p>To leave, however, the winter birds, and to pass on to more
general observations, let me notice a curious fact about the
tree-creeper (<i>Certhia familiaris</i>) in the southern parts of the
Forest. Here there are large plantations of firs, and consequently
but few holes in the trees. To make up for this
deficiency, I have twice found the creeper&rsquo;s nest placed
inside a squirrel&rsquo;s &ldquo;cage,&rdquo; showing the same adaptability to
circumstances which is met with in the whole animal creation.
Here, too, in these thick firs build great numbers of jays; and
I have, when climbing up to their nests, more than once seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
a squirrel coming out with an egg in its claw or mouth. I
should have been inclined to have doubted the fact had I not
seen it. The sucked eggs which are so often found must, therefore,
be attributed quite as much to the squirrel as the magpie
or the jay, who have so long borne the guilt. Of course, too,
from the great extent of wood we should expect to find the
woodpeckers very plentiful. The common woodpecker, known
as the &ldquo;yaffingale&rdquo; and &ldquo;woodnacker,&rdquo; is to be seen darting
down every glade. The greater-spotted (<i>Picus major</i>) is not
unfrequent, and the lesser-spotted (<i>Picus minor</i>) in the spring
comes out of the woods and frequents the orchards of Burley
and Alum Green, boring its hole in the dead boughs.</p>
<p>And here let me notice the tenacity with which the greater-spotted
woodpecker, whose nesting habits are not elsewhere in
England so well observable, clings to its breeding-place; for I
have known it, when its eggs have been taken, to lay again in
the same hole, the eggs being, however, smaller. Mr. Farren
tells me that he has observed the same fact, which is curious, as
its ally, the green woodpecker, is so easily driven away, by even
a common starling.</p>
<p>The presence of the great black woodpecker (<i>Picus martius</i>)
has long been suspected, especially since a specimen has been
killed in the Isle of Wight, and a pair have been seen near
Christchurch.<a class="fn" id="fr_289" href="#fn_289">[289]</a> Mr. Farren, in 1862, was fortunate enough
not only to see the bird, but to discover its nest. On the
ninth of June, whilst in Pignel Wood, near Brockenhurst, he
observed the hen bird fly out of a hole placed about six feet
high in a small oak, from which he had earlier in the season
taken a green woodpecker&rsquo;s nest. Hiding himself in the bushwood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
he saw, after waiting about half an hour, the hen return,
and had no doubts as to its identity. An endeavour, however,
to secure her in the hole, with the butterfly-net which
he had with him, was unsuccessful. He was afraid to leave
the eggs, as some woodmen were working close by, and so lost
any other opportunity of making the capture. The eggs, now
in my collection, were four in number, one being slightly
addled, and are the only specimens ever taken in England.
They were laid on the bare rotten wood, the bird finding the
hole sufficiently large, as Mr. Farren had widened it when
taking the previous eggs. It is, however, remarkable that
such a shy bird should have built in such a scattered and thin
wood as Pignel, close to a public thoroughfare, and where the
woodmen had for some time past been constantly felling timber.</p>
<p>But what gives the Forest so much of its character is the
number of herons who have lately established themselves in
various parts. You can scarcely go along a stream-side without
surprising some one or two, which, as you approach,
flap their large slate-coloured wings, and fly off with a rolling,
heavy motion, circling in the air as they go. Down at Exbury,
at the mouth of the Beaulieu river, they may be seen in companies
of threes and fours, wading in the shallows, probing
their long bills into the mud and sand; and then, as the tide
comes up, making off to the freshwater ponds. They are,
however, I am afraid, rather persecuted, as they never long
here remain at one breeding station. They first took up their
abode in Old Burley Wood, and then removed to Wood
Fidley, and subsequently to Denney, and finally to Vinney
Ridge. In 1861, fifty pairs, at least, must have built in its tall
beeches. On a fine early spring morning, a long grey line of
them would perch on the neighbouring green of Dame Slough,
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
picking up the twigs of heather and flying off with them to
line their great platforms of nests; and then sailing down to
the Blackwater stream, in the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; close by, to fish. In
the morning and evening, and, in fact, all through the day, one
incessant clamour was going on, and under the trees lay great
eels, which had fallen from their nests.</p>
<p>Last year the numbers were greatly decreased, the birds
having been, perhaps, driven away by the woodcutters and
charcoal-burners employed to cut down the surrounding timber.
The sketch which stands at the head of this chapter was taken
in June&mdash;too late in the year to show any of the nests, but
several young birds were still hovering round who had not
even then quite quitted. A small colony has, too, established
itself at Boldrewood, where I trust it will be protected; for
few birds possess so much character, and give so much beauty
to the landscape.</p>
<p>Before we conclude, let us glance at some other peculiarities
of the Forest district, and its effects on its birds. It is not
too far westward for the east winds to bring the hoopoe, so
common in Sussex. Throughout the summer of 1861, a pair
were constantly flying about and hopping on the &ldquo;Lawn&rdquo; near
Wilverley Forest Lodge. The black redstart (<i>Sylvia tithys</i>)
and the fire-crest (<i>Regulus ignicapillus</i>) just skim its borders
in their westerly winter migrations. Small flocks of dotterel
make it their halting spot for a few days in spring, on their
way to their northern breeding-places. In the winter, its mildness
brings numbers of siskins, some few bramblings, and the
common and even the parrot crossbill, escaping from the frosts
of the north.</p>
<p>Other things may be mentioned. The hawfinches do not
stay all the year round, as might be expected, or, at least, only
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
one or two pairs, simply because there are no hornbeams in
the Forest, nor gardens to tempt them with their fruits. The
chough, too, is seldom seen, its eggs and young being plundered
in the Isle of Wight cliffs and the Lulworth rocks. It is now
extinct in Sussex, and will soon be in the New Forest. Yet
these birds were once so numerous in England, not only
damaging the crops, but unthatching the barns and houses,
that a special Act of Parliament was passed against them.<a class="fn" id="fr_290" href="#fn_290">[290]</a>
Twopence for a dozen heads were given. People were, under
various penalties, bound to destroy them, and parishes were
ordered to keep chough and crow nets in repair.</p>
<p>There is, unfortunately, no other forest in England by which
we can make comparisons with the ornithology of the New
Forest. In Churchill Babington&rsquo;s excellent synopsis of the birds
of Charnwood Forest, we find only one hundred and twenty-five
species, but little more than one-half of those in the New Forest.
Out of the three hundred and fifty-four British birds the New
Forest possesses seventy-two residents, whilst it has had no less
than two hundred and thirty killed or observed within its boundaries.<a class="fn" id="fr_291" href="#fn_291">[291]</a>
With this we must end. I am afraid it is too late to
protest against the slaughter of our few remaining birds of prey.
The eagle and kite are, to all purpose, extinct, in England,
and the peregrine and honey-buzzard will soon share their fate.
The sight of a large bird now calls out all the raffish guns
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
of a country-side. Ornithologists have, however, themselves to
thank. With some honourable exceptions, I know no one so
greedy as a true ornithologist. The botanist does not uproot
every new flower which he discovers, but&mdash;for he loves them
too well&mdash;carefully spares some plants to grow and increase;
whilst few ornithologists rest content till they see the specimen
safe in their cabinets. This, I suppose, must be, from the
nature of the study, the case. Still, however, the love for
Nature, and the enthusiasm which it gives, must be regarded
as a far greater offset. And here let me, for the last time, say
that I feel sure that nobody knows anything of the true charms
of the country who is ignorant of natural history. With the
slightest love and knowledge of it, then every leaf is full of
meaning, every pebble a history, every torn branch, gilded with
lichens, and silvered with mosses, has its wonders to tell; and
you will find life in the dust, and beauty in the commonest
weed.</p>

<h2>APPENDICES.</h2>
<h2 id="c24">APPENDIX I.
<br /><span class="small">A GLOSSARY OF SOME OF THE PROVINCIALISMS USED IN THE NEW FOREST.</span></h2>
<p>I could easily have expanded the following glossary to three times its
size, but my object is to give only some specimens of those words which
have not yet found their way into, or have not been fully explained
in Mr. Halliwell&rsquo;s or Mr. Wright&rsquo;s dictionaries of provincialisms. The
following collection is, I believe, the first ever made of the New Forest,
or even, with the exception of the scanty list in Warner,<a class="fn" id="fr_292" href="#fn_292">[292]</a> of Hampshire
provincialisms, which of course to a certain extent it represents,&mdash;more
especially those of the western part of the county. A separate
work, however, would be needed to give the whole collection, and the
following examples must here suffice.</p>
<p>Of course I do not say that all these words are to be found only
in the New Forest. Many of them will doubtless be elsewhere discovered,
though they hitherto, as here, have escaped notice. The
time, however, for assigning the limits of our various provincialisms
and provincial dialects has not yet arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>The use of the personal pronoun &ldquo;he,&rdquo; as, throughout the West
of England, applied to things alike animate and inanimate, and the
substitution of &ldquo;thee&rdquo; for you, when the speaker is angry, or wishes
to be emphatic, may be here noticed. In the Forest, too, as in parts
of Berkshire, a woman when employed upon out-door work is sometimes
spoken of in the masculine gender, as the Hungarians are
falsely said to have done of their queen on a certain memorable occasion.
The confusion of cases which has been noticed by philologists
is here, as in other parts of England, rather the result of ignorance
than a peculiar character of the dialect.</p>

This word exactly corresponds to
the American &ldquo;guess&rdquo; (which, by the

as indefinitely in the New Forest. If

<p><span class="sc">Bower-Stone</span>, A. A boundary-stone.
Called a &ldquo;mere-stone&rdquo; in some of the
Midland Counties. Perhaps from the
Keltic <i>bwr</i>, an inclosure, intrenchment;
just as manor is said to be
from <i>maenawr</i>, a district with a stone
bound.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bound-Oak.</span> <i>See</i> Oak, Mark-.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Brownies</span>, The. The bees. <i>See</i>
chap. xvi., <a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Brow.</span> Mr. Halliwell and Mr. Wright
give this as a Wiltshire word, in the
sense of brittle. In the New Forest it
is applied only to short, snappy, splintering
timber of bad quality.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Buck</span>, The. The stag-beetle, so called
from its strong horn-like <i>antenn&aelig;</i>. The
children, when catching it, sing this
snatch&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;High buck,</p>
<p class="t0">Low buck,</p>
<p class="t0">Buck, come down.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is also called pinch-buck. The female
is known as the doe. <i>See</i> &ldquo;Bryanston
Buck,&rdquo; in Mr. Barnes&rsquo;s <i>Glossary of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
Dorsetshire Dialect</i>, appended to his
<i>Poems of Rural Life</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Bunch">Bunch</span></span>, A. A blow, or the effects of
a blow; and then a blotch, burn, scald,
pimple, in which latter senses &ldquo;bladder&rdquo;
is also often used. The verb &ldquo;to bunch,&rdquo;
to strike, is sometimes heard. <i>See</i> Wedgwood
(vol. i. p. 269, and vol. ii. p. 263)
on its allied forms. Used by Pope, <i>Iliad</i>,
bk. ii. 328.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cammock</span>, The. (From the Old-English
<i>cammec</i>, <i>cammoc</i>, <i>cammuc</i>.) The
various species of St. John&rsquo;s-wort, so
plentiful in the neighbourhood of the
New Forest; then, any yellow flower,
as the fleabane (<i>Pulica dysenterica</i>)
and ragwort (<i>Senecto Jacob&aelig;a</i>). In
Dorsetshire, according to Mr. Barnes,
it only means the rest-harrow (<i>Ononis
arvensis</i>).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cass</span>, A. A spar used in thatching,
called in the Midland and North-Western
Counties a &ldquo;buckler.&rdquo; Before it is made
into a cass, it is called a &ldquo;spargad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cattan</span>, A. A sort of noose or
hinge, which unites the &ldquo;hand-stick&rdquo;
to the flail. It is made in two parts.
The joint which joins the &ldquo;hand-stick&rdquo;
is formed of ash or elm, whilst that
which fits the flail is made of leather,
as it is required to be more flexible
near the part which strikes the floor.
Mr. Wright and Mr. Halliwell give as
a North-country word the verb &ldquo;catton,&rdquo;
to beat, with which there is evidently
some connection.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Childag</span>, A. A chilblain. Often
called simply a &ldquo;dag,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chilbladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cleet</span>, A. More generally used in
the plural, as &ldquo;cleets.&rdquo; Iron tips on a
shoe. Hence we have the expression,
&ldquo;to cleet oxen,&rdquo; that is, to shoe them
when they work.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Close.</span> Hard, sharp. &ldquo;It hits close,&rdquo;
means it hits hard.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Cothe">Cothe</span>.</span> (From the Old-English
&ldquo;co&eth;a, co&eth;e.&rdquo;) A &ldquo;cothe sheep,&rdquo; means
a sheep diseased in its liver. The
springs in the New Forest are said &ldquo;to
cothe&rdquo; the sheep&mdash;that is, to disease
their livers. Hence we have such
places as &ldquo;Cothy Mead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cothy
Copse.&rdquo; Mr. Barnes (as before) gives
the form &ldquo;acothed,&rdquo; as used in Dorsetshire.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crink-crank.</span> &ldquo;Crink-crank words&rdquo;
are long words&mdash;<i>verba sesquipedalia</i>&mdash;not
properly understood. (See <i>Proceedings
of Philological Society</i>, vol. v.
pp. 143-148.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crow-peck</span>, The. The Shepherd&rsquo;s
needle (<i>Scandix-pecten Veneris</i>); called
also &ldquo;old woman&rsquo;s needle.&rdquo; There is a
common saying in the New Forest, that
&ldquo;Two crow-pecks are as good as an oat
for a horse;&rdquo; to which the reply is,
&ldquo;That a crow-peck and a barley-corn
may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crutch</span>, A. (From the Friesic <i>kroek</i>,
connected with the Old-English <i>crocca</i>,
our crock). A dish, or earthenware
pipkin. We daily in the New Forest
and the neighbourhood hear of lard
and butter crutches. The word
&ldquo;shard,&rdquo; too, by the way, is still
used in the Forest for a cup, and
housewives still speak of a &ldquo;shard of
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cuttran</span>, A. A wren; more commonly
called a &ldquo;cutty;&rdquo; which last
word Mr. Barnes gives in his <i>Glossary
of the Dorsetshire Dialect</i>, p. 331, but
which is common throughout the West
of England. As Mr. Barnes, p. 354,
observes, the word is nothing more than
cutty wren;&mdash;the little wren. (<i>See</i>
&ldquo;Kittywitch,&rdquo; <i>Transactions of Philological
Society</i>, 1855, p. 33.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Decker</span>, or <span class="sc">Dicker</span>, To. One of
the old forms of to deck; literally, to
cover; from the Old-English &ldquo;&thorn;eccan;&rdquo;
in German, <i>decken</i>. It now, however,
only signifies to ornament or spangle.
A lady&rsquo;s fingers are said to be deckered
with rings, or the sky with stars.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Deer&rsquo;s-Milk.</span> Wood-spurge (<i>Euphorbia
amygdaloides</i>). So called from
the white viscous juice which exudes
from its stalks when gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p><span class="sc">Dount</span>, To. To dint, or imprint.
Formed, as Mr. Wedgwood remarks,
of the kindred words, dint, dent, dunt,
by an onomatopo&euml;tic process. We find
the word in an old song still sung in
the New Forest, &ldquo;A Time to remember
the Poor:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the poor harmless hare from the woods that is tracked,</p>
<p class="t">And her footsteps deep dounted in snow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Dray</span>, A. A prison; &ldquo;the cage&rdquo; of
the Midland districts. Curiously enough
the old poet William Browne, as also
Wither, speaks of a squirrel&rsquo;s nest as a
&ldquo;dray&rdquo;&mdash;still used, by-the-by, in some
counties&mdash;which in the New Forest is
always called a &ldquo;cage.&rdquo; In this last
sense Mr. Lower adds it to the glossary
of Sussex provincialisms (<i>Sussex
Arch&aelig;ological Collections</i>, vol. xiii.,
p. 215). I may further note that at
Christmas in the Forest, as in other
wooded parts of England, squirrel-feasts
are held. Two parties of boys
and young men go into the woods
armed with  &ldquo;scales&rdquo; and &ldquo;snogs&rdquo;
(see chap. xvi. <a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>), to see who
will kill the most squirrels. Sometimes
as many as a hundred or more are
brought home, when they are baked in
a pie. Their fur, too, is sought after
for its glossiness.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Drum, Ivy-</span>, An. The stem of an
ivy tree or bush, which grows round the
hole of another tree.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Drunch</span>, To. To draw up, press,
squeeze. We find the substantive
&ldquo;drunge,&rdquo; with which it is evidently
connected, given in Wright as a Wiltshire
pronunciation for pressure, or
crowd. Mr. Barnes also, in his <i>Glossary
of the Dorsetshire Dialect</i>, p. 235,
gives the forms &ldquo;dringe&rdquo; or &ldquo;drunge,&rdquo;
to squeeze or push.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Elam</span>, An. An handful of thatch.
Common both in the New Forest and
Wiltshire. In the former three elams
make a bundle, and twenty bundles
one score, and four scores a ton. In
the latter the measurement is somewhat
different, five elams forming a
bundle.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fessey.</span> (From the Old-English
<i>f&uacute;s</i>, ready, prompt, quick). Proud,
upstart. In the glossaries of Wright
and Halliwell we find &ldquo;fess&rdquo; given as
the commoner form.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fetch</span>, To. Used with reference to
churning butter. &ldquo;To fetch the butter,&rdquo;
means, to raise the cream into a certain
consistency.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fire-bladder.</span> A pimple, or eruption
on the face. <i>See</i> &ldquo;<a href="#index_Bunch">bunch</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Flisky.</span> Small, minute. Used especially
of misty rain.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Flitch</span>, or quite as often <span class="sc">Fritch</span>.
(From the Old-English <i>flit</i>, or <i>geflit</i>).
Not only as explained in the glossary of
Wiltshire, impertinent, busy, but, by
some <i>boustroph&ecirc;don</i> process, good-humoured.
&ldquo;You are very flitch to-day,&rdquo;
that is, good-natured.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fluders.</span> Worms, which on certain
land get into the livers of sheep, when
the animal is said to be &ldquo;cothed.&rdquo; Called
also &ldquo;flukes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flounders.&rdquo; <i>See</i> the
word &ldquo;<a href="#index_Cothe">cothe</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gait</span>, A. A crotchet, or, as the vulgar
expression is, a maggot. Used
always in a deprecatory sense. When a
person has done anything foolish he says,
&ldquo;this is a gait I have got.&rdquo; Doubtless,
identical with &ldquo;get&rdquo; in Wedgwood,
vol. ii. p. 144.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gettet.</span> Sprung, or slightly cracked.
Used throughout the West of England.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Giggle</span>, To. To stand awry or
crooked. Said especially of small things,
which do not stand upright.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Glutch</span>, To. (From the French
en-gloutir). Not simply, to swallow or
gulp, as explained in the glossaries, but
more especially to stifle a sob.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gold-heath</span>, The. The bog-moss,
(<i>Sphagnum squarrosum</i>), which is used
in the New Forest to make fine brooms.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gold-withey</span>, The. The bog-myrtle,
or English mock-myrtle (<i>Myrica
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
Gale</i>), mentioned in Mr. Kingsley&rsquo;s
New Forest ballad,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They wrestled up, they wrestled down,</p>
<p class="t">They wrestled still and sore;</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath their feet, the myrtle sweet,</p>
<p class="t">Was stamped in mud and gore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It grows in all the wet places in the
Forest, and is excessively sweet, the
fruit being furnished with resinous
glands. It is said to be extensively used
in drugging the beer in the district.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Graff</span>, or grampher. <i>See</i> <a href="#index_Wosset">Wosset</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gross.</span> Often used in a good sense
for luxuriant, and applied to the young
green crops, just as &ldquo;proud,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rank,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;ronk,&rdquo; as it is pronounced,
are in the Midland Counties.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gunney.</span> To look &ldquo;gunney&rdquo; means,
to look archly or cunning. There is also
the verb &ldquo;to gunney.&rdquo; &ldquo;He gunneyed
at me,&rdquo; signifies, he looked straight at
me. From the French <i>guigner</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hacker, furze-</span>, The. The whinchat,
so called from its note, which it utters on
the sprays of the furze.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hame.</span> There is a curious phrase,
&ldquo;all to hame,&rdquo; signifying, broken to
pieces, used both here and in Wiltshire.
Thus the glass, when broken, is said to
be &ldquo;all to hame,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;all to bits.&rdquo;
The metaphor has been taken from
&ldquo;spindly&rdquo; wheat on bad ground running
to halm, from the Old-English
<i>healm</i>, now the West-Saxon peasant&rsquo;s
&ldquo;hame.&rdquo; &ldquo;All to,&rdquo; I may add, is used
adverbially in its old sense of entirely,
quite, as we find it in Judges ix. 53.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Harl</span>, The. The hock of a sheep.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Harvest-Lice.</span> The seeds of the
common agrimony (<i>Agrimonia eupatoria</i>)
and &ldquo;heriff&rdquo; (<i>Galium Aparine</i>). <i>See</i>
Clivers, chap. xv. <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hell.</span> A dark place in the woods.
<i>See</i> chap. x. <a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Herder.</span> A sieve. <i>See</i> chap. xvi.
<a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>, foot-note.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_HillTrot">Hill-trot</span></span>, The. The wild carrot
(<i>Daucus Carota</i>), used also in Wiltshire.
Most probably a corruption of
eltrot, eldrot, oldroot, and so from the
Old-English. These last forms are
given in Mr. Barnes&rsquo; <i>Glossary of the
Dorset dialect</i>, p. 336.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hoar-withey.</span> The whitebeam
(<i>Sorbus Aria</i>), which, with its white
leaves, is very conspicuous in the Forest.
We find the word used in the perambulation
of the Forest in the twenty-second
year of Charles I.,&mdash;&ldquo;by the road called
Holloway, and from thence to Hore-withey,
in the place whereof (decayed)
a post standed in the ground.&rdquo; It is
exactly the same as the &ldquo;har wi&eth;ig&rdquo;
of the Old-English. It is called also,
but more rarely, the &ldquo;white rice.&rdquo; <i>See</i>
chap. xvi. <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hoo</span>, To. To simmer, boil; evidently
formed, like so many other words, by an
onomatopo&euml;tic process (<i>See</i> chap. xvi.
<a href="#Page_186">p. 186</a>). There is also the phrase, &ldquo;the
kettle is on the hoo,&rdquo; that is, to use a
vulgarism, on the simmer, or boil.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hoop</span>, To go a. To go where you
like. &ldquo;He is going a hoop,&rdquo; means, he
is going to the bad.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hum-water.</span> A cordial which is
made from the common horse-mint
(<i>Mentha aquatica</i>). Does &ldquo;hum&rdquo; here
mean strong, as it is used in some
counties with reference to beer? <i>See</i>
chap. xv. <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Joseph&rsquo;s Walking-stick.</span> The Joseph&rsquo;s-ladder
of the Midland Counties,
common in all the cottage gardens round
the Forest. It is curious to notice,
amongst our peasantry, the religious
element in the names of both the wild
and cultivated flowers derived from
Catholic times. Thus we have ladies&rsquo;
cushions, and ladies&rsquo; tresses, and St.
Peter&rsquo;s-wort, and St. John&rsquo;s-wort, besides
the more common plants, such as
marygolds and ladysmocks, which every
one can remember.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Kittering">Kittering</span>.</span> Weak. The more North-country
word &ldquo;tuly&rdquo; is also heard in
the same sense.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lance</span>, To. To jump, leap, or bound.
Used especially of the Forest deer, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
in dry weather are said &ldquo;to lance&rdquo; over
the turf.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lark&rsquo;s Lees</span>, or <span class="sc">Lease</span>, A. A piece
of poor land fit only for larks, or, as the
peasantry of the Midland Counties
would say, only &ldquo;fit to bear peewits.&rdquo;
Mr. Halliwell gives the form &ldquo;lark
leers,&rdquo; as a Somersetshire phrase; but
the above expression may be daily heard
in the New Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Louster.</span> Noise, disturbance. &ldquo;What
a louster you are making,&rdquo; signifies,
what a confusion you are causing.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lug-stick.</span> <i>See</i> <a href="#index_RugStick">Rug-stick</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mallace</span>, The. The common mallow
(<i>Malvus sylvestris</i>). Formed like
bullace, and other similar words.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Margon.</span> Corn chamomile (<i>Anthemis
arvensis</i>). Called &ldquo;mathan,&rdquo; throughout
the Anglian districts.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mark-oak</span>, <i>See</i> <a href="#index_Oak">Oak</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mokin</span>, or more generally in the
plural, <span class="sc">Mokins</span>. Coarse gaiters for defending
the legs from the furze. <i>See</i>
chap. xv. <a href="#Page_162">p. 162</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Muddle</span>, To. To fondle, caress, to
rear by the hand. Hence we obtain the
expression &ldquo;a mud lamb,&rdquo; that is, a
lamb whose mother is dead, which has
been brought up by hand, equivalent to
the &ldquo;tiddlin lamb&rdquo; of the Wiltshire
shepherds. <i>See</i> <a href="#index_Wosset">Wosset</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Oak">Oak</span>, Mark-</span>, A. The same as a
&ldquo;bound-oak,&rdquo; or boundary oak or ash,
as the case may be, so called from the
ancient cross, or mark, cut on the rind.
As Kemble notices (<i>The Saxons in
England</i>, vol. i., appendix A. p. 480),
we find in Cod. Dipl. No. 393, &ldquo;on &eth;&aacute;n
merkeden &oacute;k,&rdquo; to the marked oak, showing
how old is the name. I have never
met in the New Forest with an instance
of a &ldquo;crouch oak&rdquo; (from <i>crois</i>), such as
occurs at Addlestone in Surrey, and
which is said to have been the &ldquo;bound-oak&rdquo;
of Windsor Forest (<i>See</i> <i>The Saxons
in England</i>, as before, vol. i. chap. ii.
p. 53, foot-note). The &ldquo;bound-oak,&rdquo;
marked in the Ordnance Map near Dibden,
has fallen, but we find the name
preserved in the fine old wood of Mark
Ash, near Lyndhurst. In the perambulation
of the Forest in the 29th year of
Edward I. we read of the Merkingstak
of Scanperisgh. The various eagle-oaks
in the Forest are comparatively modern,
and must not be confounded with the
eagle-oak mentioned by Kemble (as
above, vol. i. p. 480).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Omary Cheese.</span> An inferior sort of
cheese, made of skim-milk, called in most
parts of England &ldquo;skim Dick.&rdquo; <i>See</i>,
further on, the word <a href="#index_Rammel">Rammel</a>, and also
Vinney, chap. xvi. p. 190.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Once.</span> Sometime. &ldquo;I will pay you
once this week,&rdquo; does not mean in contradistinction
to twice, but I will pay
you sometime during the week.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Overrunner</span>, An. A shrew mouse,
which is supposed to portend ill-luck if
it runs over a person&rsquo;s foot. In Dorsetshire
it is called a &ldquo;shrocop,&rdquo; where the
same superstition is believed. <i>See</i>
Barnes&rsquo; <i>Glossary of the Dorset Dialect</i>,
p. 382.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Panshard</span>, or <span class="sc">Ponshard</span>, A. Rage,
anger. &ldquo;You have no need to get in a
panshard,&rdquo; is a most common saying.
<i>See</i> &ldquo;<a href="#index_Peel">peel</a>,&rdquo; further on.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Patchy.</span> Testy. Said of people
who proverbially &ldquo;blow hot and cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Peel">Peel</span></span>, A. A disturbance, noise. &ldquo;To
be in a peel,&rdquo; means, to be in a passion.
Used in much the same sense as the word
&ldquo;pelt,&rdquo; which is rightly explained in
the glossaries as anger, noise, rage,
though it is, perhaps, more spoken of
animals than &ldquo;peel.&rdquo; &ldquo;What a pelt
the dog is making,&rdquo; that is, barking,
would be said rather than &ldquo;peel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Picked.</span> Sharp, pointed. &ldquo;A picked
piece,&rdquo; means a field with one or more
sharp angular corners.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pity.</span> Love. &ldquo;Pity is akin to love,&rdquo;
says Shakspeare, but in the West of England
it is often the same.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Plash</span>, A. A mill-head. Winkton is
locally called Winkton Plash, this exactly
corresponding to the Weringetone of
<i>Domesday</i>, with its two mills &ldquo;<i>ad aulam</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Puck">Puck</span></span>, To. To put up sheaves, especially
of barley and oats, which are
called &ldquo;pucks.&rdquo; Used throughout the
West of England in contradistinction to
&ldquo;hiling,&rdquo; applied only to wheat, which
is placed in &ldquo;hiles.&rdquo; In Dorsetshire,
however, this last operation is called
&ldquo;stitching.&rdquo; <i>See</i> the word &ldquo;stitch&rdquo;
in Mr. Barnes&rsquo; <i>Glossary of the Dorsetshire
Dialect</i>, p. 391.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Quar</span>, A. The udder of a cow or
sheep, when hard after calving or
lambing. Beer also is said to be
&ldquo;quarred,&rdquo; when it drinks hard or
rough.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Quat-vessel</span>, The. The meadow-thistle
(<i>Carduus pratensis</i>), which is
common in the New Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Rammel">Rammel</span> Cheese.</span> The best sort of
cheese, made of cream and new milk,
in contradistinction to Omary, or Arnary,
cheese, and Hasskin cheese.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rammucky.</span> Dissolute, wanton. &ldquo;A
rammucky man,&rdquo; means a depraved character.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ramward</span>, or rather, ramhard. To
the right. A corruption of framward,
or fromward. So &ldquo;toard,&rdquo; or &ldquo;toward,&rdquo;
means to the left, that is, towards you.
Both words are used throughout the
West of England, and are good examples
of what Professor M&uuml;ller would call
&ldquo;phonetic decay.&rdquo; With them may be
compared the sailor&rsquo;s terms &ldquo;starboard&rdquo;
and &ldquo;larboard,&rdquo; on which <i>see</i> Wedgwood,
<i>Dict. of English Etymology</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 310. <i>See</i>, too, Miss Gurney on the word
&ldquo;woash,&rdquo; which in the Eastern Counties
is equivalent to &ldquo;ramward.&rdquo; <i>Glossary of
Norfolk Words</i>. <i>Transactions of the Philological
Society</i>, 1855, p. 38.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rantipole</span>, The. The wild carrot
(<i>Daucus carota</i>), so called from its bunch
of leaves. Used also in Wiltshire. <i>See</i>
<a href="#index_HillTrot">Hill-trot</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red Heath.</span> The three heaths which
grow in the New Forest&mdash;<i>Erica tetralix</i>,
<i>Erica cinerea</i>, and <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>,&mdash;are
respectively known as the bell, black,
and red heaths.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Reiaves.</span> The boards or rails put
round waggons, so as to enable them to
take a greater load. Used throughout
the West of England. <i>See</i> Mr. Barnes&rsquo;
Glossary under the word Riaves, p. 375.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rick-rack.</span> This is only used of the
weather, as &ldquo;rick-rack weather,&rdquo; that is,
stormy, boisterous weather, and far
stronger in meaning than the more common
phrase, &ldquo;cazalty weather.&rdquo; It is
evidently from the Old-English <i>r&eacute;c</i>,
vapoury, cloudy weather, and well serves
to explain the meaning of Shakspeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;rack,&rdquo; a cloud, in the well-known passage
in the <i>Tempest</i> (Act iv. sc. 1),
which has given rise to so much controversy.
Miss Gurney (<i>Transactions of
the Philological Society</i>, 1855, p. 35),
notices that &ldquo;rack&rdquo; is used in Norfolk
for mist driven by the wind.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ronge</span>, To. To kick, or play, said
of horses.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rubble</span>, To. To remove the gravel,
which is deposited throughout the
Forest in a thick layer over the beds of
clay or marl. The gravel itself is called
&ldquo;the rubblin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rue.</span> A row, or hedgerow. <i>See</i>
chap. v. <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>. In the Forest some of
the embankments, near which perhaps
the Kelts and West-Saxons lived, are
called Rew- and Row-ditch. I have,
too, heard of attics being called &ldquo;lanes,&rdquo;
possibly having reference to the &ldquo;ruelle&rdquo;
by which the space between the curtains
was formerly called.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_RugStick">Rug-stick</span></span>, also called a <span class="sc">Lug-stick</span>.
A bar in the chimney, on which &ldquo;the
cotterel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;iron scale,&rdquo; or &ldquo;crane,&rdquo;
as it is also called, to which the kettle
or pot is fastened, hangs. We find the
word still used in America as the &ldquo;ridge-pole&rdquo;
of the house, which helps us at
once to the derivation.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scale</span>, or squoyle. <i>See</i> chap. xvi. <a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scull</span>, A.(From the Old-English
<i>scylan</i>, and so, literally, a division). A
drove, or herd, or pack of low people,
always used in an opprobrious sense. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
is properly applied to fish, especially
the grey mullet which visits the coast in
the autumn, and so metaphorically to
beggars who go in companies. Milton
uses the word</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;sculls that oft</p>
<p class="t0">Bank the mid sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr"><i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book vii.</p>
</div>
<p>Shakspeare, too, speaks of &ldquo;scaled
sculls&rdquo; (<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act v.
sc. 5). The expression &ldquo;school of
whales,&rdquo; which we so often find in Arctic
and whaling voyages is nothing but
this word slightly altered. According
to Miss Gurney&rsquo;s Glossary of Norfolk
words (<i>Transactions of the Philological
Society</i>, 1855), the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; is
applied to herrings on the south-eastern
coast. Juliana Berners, in the <i>Boke of
St. Albans</i>, curiously enough says that
we should speak of &ldquo;a sculke of foxes,
and a sculle of frerys.&rdquo;&mdash;Quoted in
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s <i>Science of Language</i>, p. 61.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Setty.</span> Eggs are said to be &ldquo;setty&rdquo;
when they are sat upon.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Shammock">Shammock</span></span>, To. To slouch. &ldquo;A
shammocking man&rdquo; means an idle,
good-for-nothing person. Applied also
to animals. &ldquo;A shammocking dog,&rdquo;
means almost a thievish, stealing dog,
thus showing how the word is akin to
shamble, scamble, which last verb also
signifies to obtain any thing by false
means.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shear, after-</span>, The. The second
crop of grass. Called in the Midland
Counties &ldquo;the eddish,&rdquo; and also the
&ldquo;latter-math,&rdquo; or &ldquo;after-math.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sheets&rsquo;-axe</span>, A. An oak apple.
<i>See</i> chap. xvi. <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shelf</span>, A. A bank of sand or pebbles,
or shallow in a river, or even the ford
itself. Milton uses the word in <i>Comus</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;On the tawny sands and shelves.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Hence we got the adjective &ldquo;shelvy,&rdquo;
also in common use, and employed by
Falstaffe&mdash;&ldquo;The shore was shelvy and
shallow&rdquo; (<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
Act iii., sc. 5). It is this latter word,
which Mr. Halliwell and Mr. Wright
must mean instead of &ldquo;shelly,&rdquo; and
which they define as &ldquo;an ait in a river.&rdquo;
The word is probably from the same
Scandinavian root as shoal.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shim.</span> Lean. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a shim fellow,&rdquo;
that is, thin. It is used, I see from
Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s glossary, for a shadow, in
the western division of Sussex; and I
think I have somewhere met with it in
the sense of a ghost.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shoak</span>, <span class="sc">Shock</span>, <span class="sc">Shuck</span>, Off, To. To
break off short. Thus gravel is said to
shock off at any particular stratum, or
&ldquo;list,&rdquo; or &ldquo;scale,&rdquo; as it would be called.
<i>See</i> <a href="#index_Shock">the following word</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Shock">Shock</span></span>, A. Not applied merely to
corn, but to anything else. &ldquo;A shock
of sand&rdquo; means a line or band of sand,
called also a &ldquo;list,&rdquo; or &ldquo;lissen,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bond,&rdquo; or &ldquo;scale,&rdquo; and sometimes
&ldquo;drive:&rdquo; which last, however, has a
more particular reference to the direction
of the stratum.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Size.</span> Thickness, consistency. &ldquo;The
size of the gruel&rdquo; means its consistency.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Skimmer-Cake</span>, A. A small pudding
made up from the remnants of
another, and cooked upon a &ldquo;skimmer,&rdquo;
the dish with which the milk is skimmed.
Nearly equivalent to the &ldquo;girdle-cake,&rdquo;
north of England.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Skrow.</span> Shattered or battered.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Slab</span>, A. A thick slice, lump, used
like <a href="#index_Squab">squab</a>, which see. Thus we hear
of &ldquo;a slab of bacon,&rdquo; meaning a large
piece. Opposed to &ldquo;snoule,&rdquo; which
signifies a small bit.&mdash;&ldquo;I have just had
a snoule,&rdquo; means I have only had a
morsel.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Slink</span>, A. &ldquo;A slink of a thing,&rdquo; in
which phrase the word is only found, is
alike applied to objects animate or inanimate,
and means either a poor, weak,
starved creature, or anything which is
small and not of good quality.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Slut</span>, A. A noise, sound. &ldquo;A slut
of thunder,&rdquo; means a clap or peal of
thunder. It is in this sense that the
word is most generally used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p><span class="sc">Snake-Fern.</span> The hard-fern (<i>Blechnum
boreale</i>). <i>See</i> &ldquo;<a href="#index_AddersFern">Adder&rsquo;s-Fern</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sniggle</span>, To. To snarl. <i>See</i> chap. xvi.,
<a href="#Page_186">p. 186</a>. <span class="sc">Sniggle</span>, A. An eel peculiar
to the Avon. <i>See</i> chap. xii., pp. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>,
<a href="#Page_126">126</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spell</span>, A. A fit, or start. Pain is
said to come and go by &ldquo;spells,&rdquo; that is,
by shocks at recurring intervals.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spene</span>, A. In its first sense, like
the Old-English <i>spana</i>, an udder of a
cow. In its second, the rail of a gate
or stile.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spine-Oak.</span> The heart of oak. This
phrase points to the true derivation of
&ldquo;heart of oak.&rdquo; The common theory
Mr. Wedgwood has rightly classed
under the head of &ldquo;<i>False Etymologies</i>.&rdquo;
<i>See</i> <i>Transactions of the Philological
Society</i>, 1855. No. 6, pp. 62, 63.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spire-Bed</span>, A. A place where the
&ldquo;spires,&rdquo; that is, the reed-canary grass
(<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>), grow; exactly
equivalent to the Old-English <i>hreod-bedd</i>.
On the outskirts of the New
Forest at Redbridge, formerly Redford&mdash;Hreodford,
literally, the ford of reeds&mdash;the
Test is to this day full of the same
&ldquo;spires,&rdquo; from which our forefathers
gave the place its name. The river
Caundle, in Dorsetshire, still, too, full
of spire-beds, tells of a similar derivation,
not from the Teutonic, but the
Keltic. The phrase &ldquo;spire-bed,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;spear-bed field,&rdquo; is very common,
meaning a particular field, near where
the &ldquo;spires&rdquo; grow, which are used
by plasterers and thatchers in their
work.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spith.</span> (Another form of pith, from
the Old-English &ldquo;pi&eth;a&rdquo;). Strength,
force.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sprack.</span> Not only quick, lively, brisk,
active, as given in the glossaries, but
neat, tidy. Used also in this last sense
in Wiltshire.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spratter.</span> The common guillemot
(<i>Uria troile</i>). In Norfolk (<i>see</i> <i>Transactions
of the Philological Society</i>, 1855,
p. 37) we have &ldquo;sprat-mowe,&rdquo; for a
herring-gull; and in Kent, &ldquo;sprat-loon,&rdquo;
for one of the grebes.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Squab">Squab</span></span>, A. Anything large. Thus
&ldquo;a squab of a piece,&rdquo; is constantly used
in this sense. In a different meaning it
is confounded with squat. So a thick-set,
heavy person is called a &ldquo;squab.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Squoyles.</span> Glances. <i>See</i> chap. xvi.,
<a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stabble.</span> Marks, footprints, always
used in the plural. This is another of
those onomatopo&euml;tic words which Mr.
Wedgwood might add to the forms
step, stamp, stipple, all derived by a
similar process. (<i>See</i> the Introduction
to his <i>Dictionary of Etymology</i>, p. x.)
In an old rhyme, common in the New
Forest, upon a hailstorm, we find the
word:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Go round the ricks,</p>
<p class="t0">And round the ricks,</p>
<p class="t0">And make as many stabble</p>
<p class="t0">As nine score sheep.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Starky.</span> Used particularly of land
which is stiff or unworkable, especially
after rain, and opposed to &ldquo;stoachy,&rdquo;
which signifies muddy, as in the common
expression, &ldquo;What a dreadful
stoachy piece of ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Thrifty.</span> Still used in its old derivative
sense of thriving, and so flourishing.
Once or twice I have heard it applied to
physical health, in the sense of being
well, or &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; as is the more common
saying.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tine</span>, To. To tine a candle, does
not now so much mean to light, from
the Old-English <i>tendan</i>, to set on fire,
as to snuff it.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tuffet</span>, A. A lump of earth, or hillock.
Hence we have &ldquo;tuffety,&rdquo; in the
sense of uneven, or covered with hillocks.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tuly.</span> Weak, ailing. More common
in the north of England. <i>See</i> &ldquo;<a href="#index_Kittering">Kittering</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Twiddle</span>, To. To whistle. &ldquo;The
robins are twiddling,&rdquo; is a common
phrase, and which fact is said to be a
sign of rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p><span class="sc">Vinney-Cheese.</span> <i>See</i> chap. xvi.,
<a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wag</span>, A. A breath, a slight wind.
&ldquo;A wag of air,&rdquo; means a gentle draught
of air. In Dorsetshire we still have
&ldquo;wag-wanton&rdquo; applied to the quaking-grass
(<i>Briza media</i>). <i>See</i> Barnes&rsquo; <i>Glossary
of the Dorsetshire Dialect</i>, p. 404.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wase</span>, A. A very small bundle of
straw, more particularly a wisp for cleaning
a horse. Used also, according to
Mr. Cooper, in Sussex.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Water-Tables.</span> The side dikes
along the road, which carry off the
water. Common throughout the West
of England.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Weald</span>, To. To bring corn or hay
into swathe, before putting it, as it is
called, into &ldquo;<a href="#index_Puck">puck</a>,&rdquo; which see.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wean-Gate</span>, A. (From the Old-English
<i>w&aelig;n-geat</i>, literally, the waggon-door.)
The tail-board, or ladder of a
waggon.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Well-Crook</span>, A. A stick for ladling
the water out of the shallow Forest
pools and wells. Called in the Midland
and Northern Counties a &ldquo;lade-gorn;&rdquo;
and formerly &ldquo;a well graper.&rdquo; (<i>See</i>
Froude&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>, vol. i.
p. 41, foot-note.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wimble</span>, A. In addition to auger,
as given in Wright and Halliwell&rsquo;s
dictionaries, an instrument with which
to take up faggots or trusses of hay.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wivvery.</span> Giddy. &ldquo;My head is
wivvery,&rdquo; is no uncommon expression.
To wivver, given by Wright and Halliwell
as used in Kent, is more especially
employed here of the quivering flight
of hawks, particularly of the kestrel and
hen-harrier.</p>
<p><span class="sc"><span id="index_Wosset">Wosset</span></span>, A. A small ill-favoured
pig. The smallest pig in a &ldquo;trip,&rdquo; to
use a West-Country term for a litter, is
known as the &ldquo;doll,&rdquo; the same as the
&ldquo;nessle-tripe&rdquo; of Dorsetshire; whilst a
pig brought up by hand is called a
&ldquo;graff,&rdquo; or &ldquo;grampher,&rdquo; equivalent to
&ldquo;mud,&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;mud-lamb,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;mud-calf,&rdquo; as also &ldquo;sock,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sockling,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;tiddling,&rdquo; used in various
counties.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Yape</span>, To. Not merely to gossip, as
given by Mr. Cooper in his <i>Sussex
Glossary</i>, but to loiter. To yape about
is used very much as is <a href="#index_Shammock">shammock</a>,
which see.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Yaw</span>, To. To chop, reap. Used of
cutting corn, peas, or beans. &ldquo;Hacking,&rdquo;
however, is generally the term
applied to harvesting the last, when
the reapers use two hooks, one to cut,
and the other, an old one, to pull up
the halm.</p>

<br /><span class="small">THE FLOWERING PLANTS OF THE NEW FOREST DISTRICT.</span></h2>
<p>These lists are not by any means put forward as exhaustive. Subsequent
investigations must very much increase them. Still, I trust
they will be found sufficient for botanists to generalize from, and useful
as guides to beginners. To the kindness of the Rev. H. M. Wilkinson,
of Bisterne, I am much indebted, as will be seen, for many new species
and localities, as also for the special arrangement of the <i>Gramine&aelig;</i>,
<i>Cyperace&aelig;</i>, and <i>Juncace&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>The nature of the country will best help us to make the divisions.
First, we have the true Forest district, with its heath, and bog, and
woodland plants; and next the valley of the Avon, with its meadow-flowers;
and, thirdly, the littoral plants, which we will at once take.</p>

such as <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>, <i>Gentiana Pneumonanthe</i>,

<h2 id="c26">APPENDIX III.
<br /><span class="small">LIST OF THE BIRDS OF THE NEW FOREST DISTRICT.</span></h2>
<p>The best plan is, perhaps, to arrange the birds in groups, and to give a
short analysis of each section, so that the reader may be able to see at
a glance the more characteristic as well as rarer species. We will first
of all take the Residents. In making out this list I have been principally
guided&mdash;with of course certain exceptions&mdash;by the rule of
admitting every bird whose nest has been found upon reliable evidence,
as we may be sure that for one nest which is discovered a dozen or
more remain undetected.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Peregrine Falcon.</span> (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>,
Gmel.) As this bird breeds so near,
both in the Isle of Wight and along the
Dorsetshire coast, it may be considered
as a resident. From different lists before
me, ranging over several years, it appears
to have been shot and trapped in the
Forest at all seasons.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Merlin.</span> (<i>Falco &aelig;salon</i>, Gmel.) <i>See</i>
Chapter XXII., pp. <a href="#Page_266">266</a>, <a href="#Page_267">267</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kestrel.</span> (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>, Lin.)
Numerous.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sparrow Hawk.</span> (<i>Falco nisus</i>, Lin.)
More abundant than even the kestrel,
especially in the southern part of the
Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Buzzard.</span> (<i>Falco buteo</i>, Lin.)
Breeds in nearly all the old woods, but
is becoming scarce. <i>See</i> Chapter XXII.,
<a href="#Page_265">p. 265</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Marsh Harrier.</span> (<i>Circus &aelig;ruginosus</i>,
Lin.) Rare.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hen Harrier.</span> (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>, Lin.)
<i>See</i> Chapter XXII., <a href="#Page_268">p. 268</a>. This bird
has become much more numerous of
late. No less than six or seven pairs
were, I am sorry to say, trapped last year.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Long-Eared Owl.</span> (<i>Strix otus</i>,
Lin.) Not unfrequent. I have found it
nesting round Mark Ash and Boldrewood.
Mr. Rake tells me that Amberwood
is also a favourite breeding station.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Barn Owl.</span> (<i>Strix flammea</i>, Lin.)
Not so common as might be expected.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tawny Owl.</span> (<i>Strix aluco</i>, Lin.)
The most common of the three. Very
often this bird may be seen during the
day in the Forest mobbed by thrushes
and blackbirds, and taking refuge in
some of the large ivy-bushes.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Missel Thrush.</span> (<i>Turdus viscivorus</i>,
Lin.) Known throughout the Forest
as the &ldquo;Bull thrush.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Song Thrush.</span> (<i>Turdus musicus</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blackbird.</span> (<i>Turdus merula</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Robin Redbreast.</span> (<i>Sylvia rubecula</i>,
Lath.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stonechat.</span> (<i>Sylvia rubicula</i>, Lath.)
Mr. Rake tells me that it breeds rather
plentifully round Ogdens and Frogham,
about two miles from Fordingbridge. I
have also had the eggs brought me from
Wootton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p><span class="sc">Dartford Warbler.</span> (<i>Sylvia provincialis</i>,
Ks. and Bl.) Is sometimes
very common in the Forest, and is
generally to be seen in company with
the whinchat. In some years, as in 1861,
it is scarce. I have its nest, with two
eggs, in my collection, taken by Mr.
Farren, on Lyndhurst Heath, April 29th,
1862; but it is always difficult to find,
as the bird frequents, in the breeding
season, the thickest part of the high
furze.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Goldencrested Regulus.</span> (<i>Regulus
cristatus</i>, Koch.) Not uncommon.
Known throughout the Forest as &ldquo;The
thumb bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus major</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blue Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cole Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus ater</i>, Lin.)
Far more common than the next.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Marsh Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus palustris</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Long-tailed Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus
caudatus</i>, Lin.) Known throughout
the Forest as the &ldquo;Long-tailed caffin,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;cavin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pied Wagtail.</span> (<i>Motacilla Yarrellii</i>,
Gould.) Partially migratory.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grey Wagtail.</span> (<i>Motacilla boarula</i>,
Lin.) After some hesitation, I have
decided to put this bird among the residents.
Yarrell (vol. i., 434) mentions it
breeding near Fordingbridge, close to
the upper boundary of the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Meadow Pipit.</span> (<i>Anthus pratensis</i>,
Bechst.) The &ldquo;Butty lark,&rdquo; that is,
companion bird, of the New Forest; so
called because it is often seen pursuing
the cuckoo, which the peasant takes
to be a sign of attachment instead of
anger.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rock Pipit.</span> (<i>Anthus obscurus</i>, Keys
and Bl.) Inhabits the muddy shores of
the south-eastern district.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sky Lark.</span> (<i>Alauda arvensis</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wood Lark.</span> (<i>Alauda arborea</i>, Lin.)
Mr. Rake found its nest on Goreley race-course,
near Fordingbridge, on the 2nd
of April, 1861, with three eggs.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Bunting.</span> (<i>Emberiza miliaria</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blackheaded Bunting.</span> (<i>Emberiza
sch&oelig;niclus</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Yellow Hammer.</span> (<i>Emberiza citrinella</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cirl Bunting.</span> (<i>Emberiza cirlus</i>,
Lin.) I have had its eggs brought to
me from the neighbourhood of Wootton;
and Mr. Farren found a nest with three
eggs in 1861, close to the village of
Brockenhurst.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chaffinch.</span> (<i>Fringilla c&oelig;lebs</i>, Lin.)
The &ldquo;Chink&rdquo; of the New Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">House Sparrow.</span> (<i>Fringilla domestica</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Greenfinch.</span> (<i>Fringilla chloris</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hawfinch.</span> (<i>Fringilla coccothraustes</i>,
Lin.) A few pair now and then certainly
remain in the Forest to breed, though
I have never been fortunate enough to
obtain their eggs. Great quantities
were killed at Burley in the spring of
1858.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Goldfinch.</span> (<i>Fringilla carduelis</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bullfinch.</span> (<i>Loxia pyrrhula</i>, Lin.)
Always to be seen very busy in November
amongst the young buds just formed,
in the cottage gardens near the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Starling.</span> (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Raven.</span> (<i>Corvus corax</i>, Lin.) Becoming
very scarce. <i>See</i> Chapter
XXII., pp. <a href="#Page_269">269</a>, <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crow.</span> (<i>Corvus corone</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rook.</span> (<i>Corvus frugilegus</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Jackdaw.</span> (<i>Corvus monedula</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Jay.</span> (<i>Corvus glandarius</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Green Woodpecker.</span> (<i>Picus viridis</i>,
Lin.) &ldquo;The yaffingale&rdquo; and
&ldquo;woodnacker&rdquo; of the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spotted Woodpecker.</span> (<i>Picus major</i>,
Lin.) Both this and the next are
known throughout the Forest as the
&ldquo;wood-pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lesser-Spotted Woodpecker.</span>
(<i>Picus minor</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Creeper.</span> (<i>Certhia familiaris</i>, Lin.)
Builds in the holes of the old ash and
thorn trees. <i>See</i>, however, Chapter
XXII., <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p><span class="sc">Wren.</span> (<i>Troglodytes Europ&aelig;us</i>,
Cuv.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nuthatch.</span> (<i>Sitta Europ&aelig;a</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kingfisher.</span> (<i>Alcedo ispida</i>, Lin.)
Not very common, yet it may now and
then be seen at Darrat&rsquo;s stream, near
Lyndhurst, the brook in the Queen&rsquo;s
Bower Wood, and the Osmanby Ford
river, near Wootton.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ringdove.</span> (<i>Columba palumbus</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stockdove.</span> (<i>Columba &aelig;nas</i>, Lin.)
Numerous, building in the holes of the
old beech-trees.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pheasant.</span> (<i>Phasianus Colchicus</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Black Grouse.</span> (<i>Tetrao tetrix</i>, Lin.)
Feeds on the young shoots of heather
and larch, seeds of grass, blackberries
and acorns, and I have seen it repeatedly
perching in the hawthorns for the sake
of the berries. The &ldquo;heath poult&rdquo; of the
Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Partridge.</span> (<i>Perdix cinerea</i>, Lath.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lapwing.</span> (<i>Vanellus cristatus</i>, Meyer.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Heron.</span> (<i>Ardea cinerea</i>, Lath.) <i>See</i>
Chapter XXII., pp. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>, <a href="#Page_274">274</a>. I have
known a pair lay, in one instance, at
Boldrewood, as late as June 23rd.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Redshank.</span> (<i>Totanus calidris</i>,
Lin.) This bird is certainly a resident
throughout the year. I have
repeatedly put it up during the autumn
in some of the swamps near Stoney
Cross, more especially in the evening,
when it will hover round and round,
just keeping overhead, not unlike a
pewit. Several nests are yearly taken.
Last year Mr. Farren found one near
Burley, April 4th, with a single egg,
and another, May 3rd, containing four,
at Bishopsditch.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Woodcock.</span> (<i>Scolopax rusticola</i>,
Lin.) Breeds in great numbers in some
seasons.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Snipe.</span> (<i>Scolopax gallinago</i>,
Lin.) The greatest numbers
occur in December, though many remain
to breed not only in the &ldquo;bottoms&rdquo;
of the Forest, but the meadows of the
Avon. Mr. Rake informs me that a
Sabine&rsquo;s snipe (<i>Scolopax Sabini</i>,
Vigors), which is now generally regarded
as only a melanism of this
species, was shot at Picket Post, Jan.,
1859. Another was shot not far from
the borders of the Forest, at Heron
Court, 1836.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Water Rail.</span> (<i>Rallus aquaticus</i>,
Lin.) Most common in the winter.
Some few, however, breed in the valley of
the Osmanby Ford stream, where I have
seen a pair or two in the summer time.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Coot.</span> (<i>Fulica atra</i>, Lin.) A
straggler generally every year remains
to breed on the Avon.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mute Swan.</span> (<i>Cygnus olor</i>, Boie.)
Large numbers belonging to Lord Normanton&rsquo;s
swannery may be always seen
on the Avon, near Fordingbridge and
Ibbesley.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wild Duck.</span> (<i>Anas boschas</i>, Lin.)
Breeds, like the teal, in most of the
bottoms throughout the Forest, as also
in the Avon. The fowlers round Exbury
say that the wigeon, too, stays to
nest; but I do not know of any authenticated
case. Mr. Rake has observed
the tufted duck as late in the
year as May.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Teal.</span> (<i>Anas crecca</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Grebe.</span> (<i>Podiceps minor</i>,
Lath.) Known in the Forest as the
di-dapper. A few breed in the Boldre
Water, and, perhaps, even in the Osmanby
Ford stream. Mr. Rake tells me
that it breeds plentifully in the Avon,
between Fordingbridge and Downton.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Guillemot.</span> (<i>Uria troile</i>, Lath.)
Locally known as the &ldquo;spratter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Razorbill.</span> (<i>Alca torda</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cormorant.</span> (<i>Carbo cormoranus</i>,
Meyer.) Locally known as the &ldquo;Isle
of Wight parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shag.</span> (<i>Carbo cristatus</i>, Tem.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Herring Gull.</span> (<i>Lotus argentatus</i>,
Br&uuml;n.) It is to be seen at all seasons
with the four birds above mentioned,
breeding like them in the Freshwater
Cliffs of the Isle of Wight. The shag
and the cormorant were the commonest
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
birds along the south-east coast of the
Forest in Gilpin&rsquo;s time (vol. II. pp. 172,
302, third edition), but are now becoming
rare; and Mr. More, in his
excellent account of the birds of the
Isle of Wight, doubts whether more
than one or two pairs now annually
breed in the Island.</p>
<p class="tb">Thus the Forest possesses in all seventy-two residents. The common
buzzard, the merlin, the henharrier, the three owls, and as many woodpeckers,
with the nuthatch and the stockdove, well indicate its woody
and heathy character. Upon comparing this with Mr. More&rsquo;s list of
the residents of the Isle of Wight, we find that the Forest possesses
fourteen more than that Island. The principal additions consist, as
might be expected, of the common buzzard, black-grouse, green and
great and lesser spotted woodpeckers, common snipe, and woodcock,
although by the way the last, to my knowledge, breeds in the Island,
as also probably the little grebe.</p>
<p>The summer visitors are arranged by the date of the arrival of the
main body, drawn partly from Mr. Rake&rsquo;s and my own observations. In
a few cases, as a further criterion, I have given the dates of their
nesting spread over the last four years.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Chiffchaff.</span> (<i>Sylvia rufa</i>, Lath.)
Arrives about the middle and end of
March. Common.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wheatear.</span> (<i>Sylvia &aelig;nanthe</i>, Lath.)
Follows very close after the chiffchaff;
but the bird is scarce.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sandmartin.</span> (<i>Hirundo riparia</i>,
Lath.) In 1862, Mr. Rake saw some
specimens near Fordingbridge on
March 15th, about a week earlier than
usual.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Martin.</span> (<i>Hirundo urbica</i>, Lin.)
Arrives with the sandmartin about the
end of March, though sometimes both
are seen a little earlier.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Swallow.</span> (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wryneck.</span> (<i>Yunx torquilla</i>, Lin.)
Generally to be heard about the end
of March and beginning of April.
Known in the Forest as the &ldquo;Little
Eten bird;&rdquo; and from its cry the &ldquo;Weet
bird&rdquo;. Mr. Ruke both heard and saw
one as late as Dec. 5, 1861.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Redstart.</span> (<i>Sylvia ph&oelig;nicurus</i>,
Lath.) Beginning of April.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Thicknee.</span> (<i>&OElig;dicn&aelig;mus crepitans</i>,
Tem.) It is possible that some may
remain to breed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nightingale.</span> (<i>Sylvia luscinia</i>,
Lath.) About the middle of May their
nests are mostly found in the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cuckoo.</span> (<i>Cuculus canorus</i>, Lin.)
May 26 and June 1 are the dates when
I have found its eggs placed, in one
case, at Baishley, in a hedge sparrow&rsquo;s,
and, in the other, on Beaulieu Common,
in a titlark&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blackcap.</span> (<i>Sylvia atricapilla</i>,
Lath.) Arrives about the beginning
and middle of April.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ray&rsquo;s Wagtail.</span> (<i>Motacilla campestris</i>,
Pall.) Known in the New
Forest as the &ldquo;Barley bird,&rdquo; as it appears
about the time barley is sown.
Probably does not breed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grasshopper Warbler.</span> (<i>Sylvia
locustella</i>, Lath.) Breeds in the young
plantations, but is by no means common.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sedge Warbler.</span> (<i>Sylvia Phragmitis</i>,
Bechst.) Very scarce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p><span class="sc">Willow Wren.</span> (<i>Sylvia trochilus</i>,
Lath.) Many are to be seen about the
middle and end of April in the young
enclosures, where I have frequently
caught the bird on its nest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wood Wren.</span> (<i>Sylvia sibilatrix</i>,
Bechst.) Its nests and eggs are generally
found about the same time as the
willow wren&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Whitethroat.</span> (<i>Sylvia cinerea</i>,
Lath.) Common.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lesser Whitethroat.</span> (<i>Sylvia
curruca</i>, Lath.) Not abundant.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Whinchat.</span> (<i>Sylvia rubetra</i>, Lath.)
Known throughout the Forest as the
&ldquo;Furze Hacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tree Pipit.</span> (<i>Anthus arboreus</i>,
Bechst.) Common.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Reed Wren.</span> (<i>Sylvia arundinacea</i>,
Lath.) The five foregoing species come
much about the same time, namely, the
end of April, but the reed wren is excessively
scarce in the Forest, and I
have only once or twice heard its note
in the Beaulieu river. Mr. Hart assures
me that it builds on the banks of the
Avon, but its nest has yet to be found.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Landrail.</span> (<i>Gallinula crex</i>, Lath.)
About the end of April or beginning of
May. A good many yearly build round
Milton, and the south parts of the
Forest, and even in the interior, as at
Fritham and Alum Green.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Sandpiper.</span> (<i>Totanus hypoleucos</i>,
Tem.) A pair now and then
remain to breed at Whitten pond, near
Burley, and also at Ocknell.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Turtle Dove.</span> (<i>Columba turtur</i>,
Lin.) Not uncommon. Makes a slight
framework of heather for a nest, which
it places in a furze bush or low holly.
Is extremely shy, and easily forsakes
its eggs.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Swift.</span> (<i>Cypselus apus</i>, Illig.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nightjar.</span> (<i>Caprimulgus Europ&aelig;us</i>,
Lin.) Known throughout the Forest
as the &ldquo;Night Hawk,&rdquo; &ldquo;Night Crow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ground Hawk,&rdquo; from its habits, and
manner of flying. I have received its
eggs at all dates, from the middle of
May to the end of July.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spotted Flycatcher.</span> (<i>Muscicapa
grisola</i>, Lin.) Arrives about the same
time as the three preceding, namely,
the beginning of May.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Redbacked Shrike.</span> (<i>Lanius collurio</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hobby.</span> (<i>Falco subbuteo</i>, Lath.)
Generally breeds from the beginning to
the end of June. Mr. Farren, however,
in 1861, found a nest containing
three eggs so early as May 28th. See
Chapter XXII. <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Honey Buzzard.</span> (<i>Falco apivorus</i>,
Lin.) Never arrives before the end of
May. See Chapter xxii. pp. <a href="#Page_262">262</a>-265.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Puffin.</span> (<i>Mormon fratercula</i>, Tem.)
Comes to the Barton cliffs from the Isle
of Wight, where it breeds.</p>
<p class="tb">Here, as before, the list clearly indicates the nature of the country.
The wheatear proclaims the down-like spaces on the tops of the hills,
whilst the hobby and the honey-buzzard tell of the vast extent of woods.
In the following division the winter birds speak, instead, of the morasses
and bogs, and the river estuaries and mudbanks, which surround the
Forest district.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Shorteared Owl.</span> (<i>Strix brachyotus</i>,
Gmel.) Not uncommon. Mr. Cooper,
the Forest Keeper to whom I have before
referred, tells me that in winter and late
in the autumn for twenty years past he has
invariably met specimens in heathy and
marshy spots at Harvestslade between
Burley and Boldrewood. A specimen
was killed in November, 1860, in Dibden
Bottom, by L. H. Cumberbatch, Esq.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p><span class="sc">Fieldfare.</span> (<i>Turdus pilaris</i>, Lin.)
Large numbers frequent the Forest,
where it is known as the &ldquo;blacktail.&rdquo;
It especially frequents the hawthorn,
and seldom approaches the hollies till
the berries of the former are all eaten.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Siskin.</span> (<i>Fingilla spinus</i>, Lin.) Now
and then taken by the birdcatchers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lesser Redpole.</span> (<i>Fingilla linaria</i>,
Lin.) I should not be surprised if this
was discovered to breed in the Forest,
as so many pair are seen late in the
spring.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crossbill.</span> (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>, Lin.)
Not uncommon. In Dec., 1861, a large
flock frequented the plantations round
Burley. A few pair are sometimes to
be seen in the summer, and Mr. Farren
mentions a nest built in a fir-tree in a
garden near Lyndhurst, June, 1858,
off which the birds were shot, but unfortunately
not preserved, though their
identity is beyond dispute.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hooded Crow.</span> (<i>Corvus cornix</i>,
Lin.) Not unfrequent.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Golden Plover.</span> (<i>Charadrius
pluvialis</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ringed Plover.</span> (<i>Charadrius hiaticula</i>,
Lin.) Known, with the dunlin,
in the neighbourhood of Christchurch
and Lymington, as the &ldquo;oxbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sanderling.</span> (<i>Calidris arenaria</i>,
Leach.) Not uncommon on the coast,
especially in Christchurch harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bittern.</span> (<i>Ardea stellaris</i>, Lin.)
Not a year passes without several specimens
being brought to the bird stuffers.
Mr. Rake tells me that five were killed
close to Fordingbridge in the winter of
1858.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Curlew.</span> (<i>Numenius arquata</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Green Sandpiper.</span> (<i>Totanus ochropus</i>,
Tem.) Rather common between
Lymington and Calshot Castle. Mr.
Rake informs me that a pair were shot
at Hale, on the borders of the New
Forest, April, 1858; and Mr. Hart
tells me that he has shot several in
the summer in Stanpit Marsh. In
June, 1862, I saw several pair near
Leap, so that it probably breeds on the
coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Jack Snipe.</span> (<i>Scolopax gallinula</i>,
Lin.) Mr. Cooper tells me that he has
known this bird lie so close that he has
walked up to it and caught it with his
hat.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Knot.</span> (<i>Tringa Canutus</i>, Lin.) Not
uncommon during the spring at Christchurch
Harbour. Mr. Tanner has a
specimen in his collection, knocked
down with a stick by a boy.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dunlin.</span> (<i>Tringa variabilis</i>, Meyer.)
By no means uncommon. See Ringed
Plover.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grey-lag Goose.</span> (<i>Anser ferus</i>,
Steph.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bean Goose.</span> (<i>Anser segetum</i>,
Gmel.) A stray bird from the Solent
sometimes finds its way to Whitten and
Ocknell ponds.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Brent Goose.</span> (<i>Anser bernicla</i>,
Illig.) Locally known as the &ldquo;Bran-goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hooper.</span> (<i>Cygnus musicus</i>, Tem.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pintail Duck.</span> (<i>Anas acuta</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wigeon.</span> (<i>Anas Penelope</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Scoter.</span> (<i>Anas nigra</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pochard.</span> (<i>Anas ferina</i>, Lin.)
Known along the coast as the &ldquo;redhead&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ker.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scaup Duck.</span> (<i>Anas marila</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tufted Duck.</span> (<i>Anas fuligula</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red-breasted Merganser.</span> (<i>Mergus
serrator</i>, Lin.) Known to the fishermen
at Christchurch as the &ldquo;razorbill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Crested Grebe.</span> (<i>Podiceps
cristatus</i>, Lath.) Appears every winter
in Christchurch harbour, and may be
seen just cresting the waves, as they
break under the Barton Cliffs. Mr. Rake
informs me that specimens were killed
at Breamore, November, 1855, and
again, Jan., 1856.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Northern Diver.</span> (<i>Colymbus
glacialis</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red-Throated Diver.</span> (<i>Colymbus
septentrionalis</i>, Lin.) Not so common as
the last.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gannet.</span> (<i>Sula Bassana</i>, Boie.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p><span class="sc">Blackheaded Gull.</span> (<i>Larus ridibundus</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kittiwake.</span> (<i>Larus tridactylus</i>,
Lath.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Gull.</span> (<i>Larus canus</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lesser Blackbacked Gull.</span> (<i>Larus
fuscus</i>, Lin.) Used formerly to
breed in the Freshwater Cliffs of the
Isle of Wight.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Blackbacked Gull.</span> (<i>Larus
marinus</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p class="tb">The difficulty in the foregoing list has been to decide which species
to insert or omit. Many which I have left out, others, perhaps,
would have given, will be found placed amongst my last catalogue of
stragglers. But before we take these, let me mention two birds of
double passage which visit the Forest.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ring-ousel.</span> (<i>Turdus torquatus</i>,
Lin.) A few appear in the spring, but
the greater body in the autumn, when
they frequent the yews and mountain
ashes, being especially fond of the sweet
berries of the former. They will hide
and skulk, much as a blackbird does, in
the furze and brambles, and old thick
hedges on the borders of the Forest.
Mr. Rake sends me the following interesting
note: &ldquo;An intelligent working
man, somewhat, too, of an ornithologist,
told me that a few years since he took
its nest with four or five eggs, near
Ringwood, having a distinct view of the
bird as she left the nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Dotterel.</span> (<i>Charadrius morinellus</i>,
Lin.) Little flocks of them
may be seen in the Forest in April, and
again in the autumn; but they stay only
for a few days.</p>
<p class="tb">These are the only two birds which I can satisfactorily class as
being truly of double passage. The common sandpiper remains to breed,
whilst the grey plover and the whimbrel are killed in the depth of
winter. The common redshank, which is generally placed in this
division, remains all the year, and the greenshank is seen in the
summer, whilst the bar-tailed godwit appears too seldom to admit of
being classified in this section. We will therefore go on to the next
list, which includes all those birds that cannot be arranged in the foregoing
divisions, with the rare stragglers which are driven here by
accident, or only appear at uncertain intervals.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Golden Eagle.</span> (<i>Falco chrysa&euml;tos</i>,
Lin.) The last seen was killed, according
to Mr. Hart, about twenty years ago,
at the mouth of Christchurch harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spotted Eagle.</span> (<i>Falco n&aelig;vius</i>,
Gmel.) A fine male specimen was shot,
Dec. 28th, 1861, by a keeper of Lord
Normanton&rsquo;s, in the plantations near
Somerley. The bird had been noticed
for some days previously hovering over
the Forest. Mr. Rake, who saw it in
the flesh, tells me that the wings
measured six feet from tip to tip, and
its weight was exactly eight pounds.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White-tailed Eagle.</span> (<i>Falco albicilla</i>,
Gmel.) <i>See</i> Chapter XXII.,
p. <a href="#Page_260">260</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Osprey.</span> (<i>Falco hali&aelig;&euml;tus</i>, Lin.)
Might almost be classed as a regular
visitor in the autumn along the coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Goshawk.</span> (<i>Falco palumbarius</i>, Lin.)
Sometimes a stray bird is killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p><span class="sc">Kite.</span> (<i>Falco milvus</i>, Lin.) Very
scarce. Mr. Farren, however, in April,
1861, was lucky enough to see a solitary
bird; and another, as L. H. Cumberbatch,
Esq., informs me, was trapped at
New Park, about six years ago, in the
winter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rough-legged Buzzard.</span> (<i>Falco
lagopus</i>, Br&uuml;n.) Mr. Rake informs me
that a specimen was trapped near Fordingbridge,
in the summer of 1857. It
is, however, more generally noticed later
in the year.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Owl.</span> (<i>Strix passerina</i>, Lath.)
When Mr. Farren first mentioned this
bird as breeding in the Forest, I was
somewhat incredulous. Subsequent inquiries,
however, have left no doubt on
my mind that the bird is sometimes
seen, though mistaken for a hawk. Mr.
Farren, as far back as 1859, found two
eggs in a hole of an oak, which seem to
have been those of this bird; and in
1862 I received information of a hawk
laying white eggs in a hollow tree, but
which were unfortunately broken. I
hope, however, some day to be able to
give more satisfactory information on
the subject.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ash-coloured Harrier.</span> (<i>Falco
cineraceus</i>, Mont.) Mr. Hart has, during
the last twenty years, received three or
four specimens to stuff&mdash;one in the
winter of 1861. Mr. Farren saw a male
bird, April, 1861.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Grey Shrike.</span> (<i>Lanius excubitor</i>,
Lin.) A straggler is now and
then killed by the Forest keepers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Woodchat Shrike.</span> (<i>Lanius rufus</i>,
Briss.) As some pairs are sometimes
to be seen in the summer, I should
not be surprised to hear of its
breeding, more especially as Mr. Bond
has obtained its eggs in the Isle of
Wight.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pied Flycatcher.</span> (<i>Muscicapa atricapilla</i>,
Lin.) A specimen was shot by
the late Mr. Toomer, Forest keeper,
June, 1857; but I cannot learn whether
male or female.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White&rsquo;s Thrush.</span> (<i>Turdus Whitei</i>,
Eyton.) Two specimens have been obtained;
one in the actual Forest shot by
a Forest keeper, and which passed into
Mr. Bigge&rsquo;s collection; and the other,
not far from its borders at Heron Court,
by Lord Malmesbury, and which is
figured in Yarrell, vol. i., p. 202. For
the best account of this bird see Mr.
Tomes&rsquo; description in the <i>Ibis</i>, vol. i.,
number iv., p. 379, of a specimen killed
in Warwickshire.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Golden Oriole.</span> (<i>Oriolus galbula</i>,
Lin.) A specimen was killed in the
Forest by one of the keepers, some fifteen
years ago.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Black Redstart.</span> (<i>Sylvia tithys</i>,
Scop.) I am almost inclined to put
this, as Mr. Knox has done in his excellent
<i>Ornithological Rambles</i> (page 193),
and Mr. More in his list of the
birds of the Isle of Wight, among the
winter visitors, so many examples having
occurred.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Sedge Warbler.</span> (<i>Sylvia
turdoides</i>, Meyer.) Mr. Farren, in June,
1858, found between Brockenhurst and
Lyndhurst, a nest, containing five eggs,
which were supposed to be those of
this bird, and were exhibited at a
meeting of the Linn&aelig;an Society. They
are now, I believe, in the collection of
Mr. Seeley.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Firecrested Regulus.</span> (<i>Regulus
ignicapillus</i>, Nawm.) Sometimes seen
in the winter, but rare.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crested Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus cristatus</i>,
Lin.) Mr. Hart has once only
received a specimen, killed in Stanpit
Marsh, near Christchurch. The bird
has also been killed in the Isle of
Wight.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bearded Titmouse.</span> (<i>Parus biarmicus</i>,
Lin.) I once received the eggs
of this bird, taken amongst the reeds of
the Boldre stream,&mdash;the only instance, I
believe, of its breeding so far south.
The bird has also been seen near Christchurch,
among the rushes close to the
mouth of the harbour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p><span class="sc">Bohemian Waxwing.</span> (<i>Bombycilla
garrula</i>, Flem.) Mr. Hart tells me that
a specimen was shot about twelve years
ago at Milton, on the south border of
the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grayheaded Wagtail.</span> (<i>Motacilla
neglecta</i>, Gould.) Very rare; but has,
on Mr. Hart&rsquo;s authority, been killed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Short-toed Lark.</span> (<i>Alauda brachydactyla</i>,
Leisl.) A specimen, caught
not far from the Forest boundary, is
now in the Rev. J. Pemberton Bartlett&rsquo;s
aviary. See <i>The Zoologist</i>, March,
1862, p. 7930.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Snow Bunting.</span> (<i>Emberiza nivalis</i>,
Lin.) A few are occasionally seen
during hard winters.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Brambling.</span> (<i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>,
Lin.) Occurs like the former bird only
during severe frosts. Mr. Rake informs
me that a pair were killed near Fordingbridge,
in February, 1853.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tree Sparrow.</span> (<i>Fringilla montana</i>,
Lin.) Rare.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mealy Redpole.</span> (<i>Fringilla borealis</i>,
Tem.) Sometimes caught by the birdcatchers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Parrot Crossbill.</span> (<i>Loxia pityopsittacus</i>,
Bechst.) Mr. Rake informs me
that one was killed at Breamore, Nov.
28th, 1855, out of a flock of a dozen,
and that a few days afterwards several
more were killed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rose-coloured Pastor.</span> (<i>Pastor
roseus</i>, Tem.) A fine male was shot
some twenty years ago, by Mr. Hart&rsquo;s
brother, at Purewell.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chough.</span> (<i>Pyrrhocorax graculus</i>,
Tem.) Becoming every year more
scarce. See Chapter XXII., pp. <a href="#Page_274">274</a>,
<a href="#Page_275">275</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Black Woodpecker.</span> (<i>Picus
martius</i>, Lin.) On its breeding habits
in Sweden, see Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s account
in the <i>Ibis</i>, vol. i., p. 264, which agrees
about the bird not making a fresh hole,
as described at pp. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>, <a href="#Page_273">273</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hoopoe.</span> (<i>Upupa epops</i>, Lin.) See
Chapter XXII., <a href="#Page_274">p. 274</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White-bellied Swift.</span> (<i>Cypselus
alpinus</i>, Tem.) Mr. Hart informs me
that a specimen was killed about ten
years ago over Christchurch harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rock Dove.</span> (<i>Columba livia</i>, Briss.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red-legged Partridge.</span> (<i>Perdix
rubra</i>, Briss.) Introduced many years
ago by the late Mr. Baring, of Somerley;
but very few, if any, are left.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Quail.</span> (<i>Perdix coturnix</i>, Lath.)
Sometimes to be seen amongst the
covies of partridges in the fields adjoining
the Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Bustard.</span> (<i>Otis tarda</i>,
Lin.) The last bustard, as mentioned
in Chapter II., <a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>, foot-note, was seen
about twenty-five years ago by one of
the Forest keepers, near Eyeworth Wood;
but though on horseback, he could not
overtake the bird, which ran across
Butt&rsquo;s Plain, aiding itself by flapping its
wings.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Bustard.</span> (<i>Otis tetrax</i>,
Lin.) A female was shot some years
ago near Heron Court; and is in Lord
Malmesbury&rsquo;s collection. <i>See</i> Eyton&rsquo;s
Rarer British Birds, p. 99.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Kildeer Plover.</span> (<i>Charadrius
vociferus</i>, Lin.) This rare straggler,
the only one ever known to have been seen
in England, was shot, April, 1859, in a
potato field close to Knapp Mill, near
Christchurch, by a man of the name of
Dowding, who was attracted to it by its
peculiar flight, such as is described by
Audubon, as also by its monotonous
cry, from which its name is taken. The
bird was brought in the flesh to Mr.
Hart, and is now in the collection of
J. Tanner, Esq. The vignette at <a href="#Page_318">p. 318</a>
well shows its difference from the common
ring dotterel.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Ringed Plover.</span> (<i>Charadrius
minor</i>, Meyer.) Very rare. Mr.
Hart has only had one specimen, brought
to him many years ago.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grey Plover.</span> (<i>Vanellus melanogaster</i>,
Bechst.) Not uncommon during
severe winters in the harbours along the
coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Turnstone.</span> (<i>Strepsilas interpres</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
Ill.) Not uncommon. My friend, Mr.
Tanner, has killed both male and female
in summer plumage.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oyster-catcher.</span> (<i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>,
Lin.) By no means uncommon.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Heron.</span> (<i>Ardea purpurea</i>,
Lin.) One or two specimens have
occasionally been shot.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Egret.</span> (<i>Ardea garzetta</i>,
Lin.) Mr. Rake informs me that one
was said to have been shot some years
ago at Hale, on the borders of the
Forest. Yarrell mentions another (vol. ii.,
p. 554) killed, in 1822, on the Stour near
Christchurch.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Squacco Heron.</span> (<i>Ardea ralloides</i>,
Scop.) A solitary specimen, shot a few
years ago at Christchurch Harbour, is
now in Lord Malmesbury&rsquo;s collection.
See Eyton&rsquo;s <i>Rarer British Birds</i>, p. 100,
where Dewhurst must probably be a
misprint for Christchurch.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Bittern.</span> <i>(Ardea minuta</i>,
Lin.) Mr. Hart, to whom I am under
so many obligations for notices of our
stragglers, informs me that a fine male
bird was shot, April, 26, 1862, on the
borders of the Forest, at Heron Court,
by one of Lord Malmesbury&rsquo;s keepers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Night Heron.</span> (<i>Nycticorax ardeola</i>,
Tem.) Mr. Hart has occasionally received
a specimen.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Glossy Ibis.</span> (<i>Ibis falcinellus</i>, Tem.)
Mr. Hart killed a young pair in a meadow
near Christchurch Harbour in September,
1859.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Whimbrel.</span> (<i>Numenius ph&aelig;opus</i>,
Lath.) Not so very uncommon during
the late autumn and winter months along
the harbours of the coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spotted Redshank.</span> (<i>Totanus
fuscus</i>, Leisl.) On the authority of Mr.
Hart, who has killed it in Christchurch
Harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Avocet.</span> (<i>Recurvirostra avocetta</i>,
Lin.) Mr. Rake informs me of a specimen
shot at Exbury, Dec. 1858.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blacktailed Godwit.</span> (<i>Limosa
melanura</i>, Leisl.) Mr. Hart received
one in the spring of 1860, and a fine
specimen was killed by one of the Forest
keepers, some twenty years ago, on
Ocknell pond. Hawker, who well knew
the sea-coast of the New Forest, mentions
large flocks of &ldquo;grey godwits&rdquo; off
Keyhaven, May, 1842, but he does not
distinguish between this and the next
species.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bartailed Godwit.</span> (<i>Limosa rufa</i>,
Briss.) Mr. Hart had two pair brought
to him from the Mudeford Marsh, in the
summer of 1861.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ruff.</span> (<i>Machetes pugnax</i>, Cuv.) A
specimen is now and then killed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Great Snipe.</span> (<i>Scolopax major</i>,
Gmel.) Generally one or two may be
seen in the Forest every winter. Mr.
Cooper, the Forest keeper, to whom I
have previously referred, tells me that
during the last twenty years he has shot
some six or seven specimens, and has
seen as many more killed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sabine&rsquo;s Snipe.</span> (<i>Scolopax Sabini</i>,
Vigors.) <i>See</i> Common Snipe (<i>Scolopax
gallinago</i>), in the list of residents,
<a href="#Page_309">p. 309</a>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Curlew Sandpiper.</span> (<i>Tringa subarquata</i>,
Tem.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Stint.</span> (<i>Tringa minuta</i>,
Leisl.) Like the preceding, not so very
unfrequent along the coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Sandpiper.</span> (<i>Tringa maritima</i>,
Br&uuml;n.) Occasionally seen in
Christchurch Harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spotted Crake.</span> (<i>Gallinula porzana</i>,
Lath.) Has been seen both in
winter and summer; and I should
not be surprised to hear of its breeding.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Baillon&rsquo;s Crake.</span> (<i>Gallinula Baillonii</i>,
Tem.) A female was shot near
Linwood, in the Forest, Nov., 1860.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grey Phalarope.</span> (<i>Phalaropus
platyrhyncus</i>, Tem.) Mr. Rake informs
me that several specimens were
killed on the Avon in the severe winter
of 1855-6, and again in 1860-1. Mr.
Tanner has a pair in his collection,
shot in the mouth of Christchurch
Harbour in summer plumage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p><span class="sc">Whitefronted Goose.</span> (<i>Anser
albifrons</i>, Bechst.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bernacle Goose.</span> (<i>Anser leucopsis</i>,
Bechst.) From Mr. Hart I learn that a
pair were killed some years ago between
Christchurch and Barton.</p>
<p><span class="sc">&AElig;gyptian Goose.</span> (<i>Anser &AElig;gyptiacus</i>,
Jenyns.) From Mr. Rake I
learn that a specimen was killed on
the Avon, near Bicton Mill, February,
1855.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bewick&rsquo;s Swan.</span> (<i>Cygnus minor</i>,
Keys and Bl.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shoveller.</span> (<i>Anas clypeata</i>, Lin.)
Mr. Rake, in his manuscript notes,
which he so kindly put in my hands,
mentions that this and the gadwall and
Bewick&rsquo;s swan, were killed on the Avon
during the hard winter of 1855.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gadwall.</span> (<i>Anas strepera</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Garganey.</span> (<i>Anas querquedula</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Eider Duck.</span> (<i>Anas mollissima</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Velvet Scoter.</span> (<i>Anas fusca</i>, Lin.)
Sometimes shot by the Mudeford fishermen,
but always outside the bar of the
harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Long-tailed Duck.</span> (<i>Anas glacialis</i>,
Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Golden Eye.</span> (<i>Anas clangula</i>, Lin.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Smew.</span> (<i>Mergus albellus</i>, Lin.) Seen,
like the two previous, during hard
winters on the Avon. Mr. Rake notes
that one was killed at Breamore, Nov.,
1855; and Mr. Hart writes that he once
saw a person kill two at one shot in
Christchurch Harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Goosander.</span> (<i>Mergus merganser</i>, Lin.)
Rather rare. Mr. Rake, however, informs
me that one male and two or
three females were killed near Fordingbridge
in the winter of 1855.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red-necked Grebe.</span> (<i>Podiceps ruficollis</i>,
Lath.) Rather rare.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sclavonian Grebe.</span> (<i>Podiceps cornutus</i>,
Lath.) Very rare. Mr. Hart has
never known an instance of one being
killed, though he has received a specimen
or two from the Dorsetshire coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Eared Grebe.</span> (<i>Podiceps auritus</i>,
Lath.) Rather rare, but occasionally
killed by the Mudeford fishermen.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Black-throated Diver.</span> (<i>Colymbus
arcticus</i>, Lin.) Occurs pretty plentifully
during some winters along the
coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Auk.</span> (<i>Uria alle</i>, Tem.)
Found sometimes along the coast after
a heavy storm.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Caspian Tern.</span> (<i>Sterna Caspia</i>, Pall.)
On the authority of Mr. Hart one was
shot, about ten years ago, in Christchurch
Harbour.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Tern.</span> (<i>Sterna hirundo</i>,
Lin.) This, with the next, is sometimes,
after a heavy gale, picked up in an
exhausted state. I saw one which had
been thus caught near Fordingbridge in

<p><span class="sc">Artic Tern.</span> (<i>Sterna arctica</i>,
Flem.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lesser Tern.</span> (<i>Sterna minuta</i>, Lin.)
Seen during a hard winter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Black Tern.</span> (<i>Sterna nigra</i>, Briss.)
A pair were, not long ago, shot by Mr.
Charles Reeks, near the Old Bridge,
Christchurch.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Little Gull.</span> (<i>Larus minutus</i>, Pall.)
Mr. Rake informs me that a pair of these
rare birds were killed near Breamore, in
November, 1855.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Glaucous Gull.</span> (<i>Larus glaucus</i>,
Br&uuml;n.) A solitary specimen has, I
believe, once been shot near Christchurch,
by the Hon. Grantley Berkeley,
in whose collection it is.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Common Skua.</span> (<i>Lestris catarractes</i>,
Ill.) Occasionally killed flying round
Christchurch Head.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fork-tailed Petrel.</span> (<i>Thalassidroma
Leachii</i>, Tem.) Mr. Rake informs
me that a specimen was picked up
dead, near Fordingbridge, November,
1859.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stormy Petrel.</span> (<i>Thalassidroma
pelagica</i>, Vigors.) Frequently picked
up dead, or exhausted, along the coast,
after severe weather, with the wind
blowing from the west.</p>

<p class="tb">Adopting Yarrell&rsquo;s census, an analysis of these lists gives to the
Forest district 72 out of the 140 British residents, 31 out of our 63
summer visitors, 35 winter visitors, and of rarer birds and stragglers,
90; or altogether, including the two birds of double passage, 230 species
out of the whole 354.</p>
<p>Since these lists were arranged, Mr. Rake sends me word, concerning
the reed wren, that in the winter of 1858, a nest, evidently built the
preceding summer, and exactly resembling that bird&rsquo;s, was found in a
thick bed of reeds on the bank of the Avon, near Fordingbridge, but
he has never seen the birds or eggs from the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>With regard to the kildeer plover, I may add that several persons
saw it in the flesh, and that Mr. Tanner received it soon after it was
mounted. My only surprise is with Dr. Sclater (see the <i>Ibis</i> vol. iv.,
No. xv., p. 277), that a bird with so large a range of flight should not
before this have been recorded as occurring in England.</p>
<p>The vignette is, with a slight alteration of position, taken from Mr.
Tanner&rsquo;s specimen.</p>

<p>As, I am sorry to say, I am entirely ignorant of entomology, Mr. Baker,
who possesses one of the finest collections of Lepidoptera in the district,
has kindly compiled the following list. For the sake of space the
Tineina have been omitted. The arrangement followed is that of
Stainton, and the whole list has, to ensure the greatest accuracy, been
revised by F. Bond, Esq., F.Z.S. No attempt has been made to
classify the rarer and more common species, as both so much vary with
the season.</p>

<p>As a further addition to my list of plants, I have
received the following from A. G. More, Esq., F.L.S.&mdash;those without
localities being communicated to him by the late Mr. Borrer as found
in the Forest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Wahlenbergia hederacea</span>, Reich.,
Ivy-leaved Bell Flower. Near Lyndhurst,
272.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sium latifolium</span>, Lin., Broad-leaved
Water Parsnep. <i>See</i> Bromfield,
in the <i>Phytologist</i>, vol. iii. p. 403; 464.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Trifolium medium</span>, Lin., <i>Zigzag</i>
Trefoil. Near Lyndhurst, 683.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Utricularia intermedia</span>, Hayne,
Intermediate Bladderwort, 876.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Carex limosa</span>, Lin., Green-and-Gold
Carex, 1244.</p>
<p class="tb">A word or two may here be added concerning the only true species of
cicada (<i>Cicada h&aelig;matoides</i>) which we have in England, and which has
hitherto been only found in the New Forest. Mr. Farren, in June, 1858,
was fortunate enough to take a specimen sitting on the stem of the
common brake, being attracted to it by its peculiar monotonous humming
noise. On the second of June, 1862, he captured two others, which
rose from the fern, with their curious zigzag flight, and at the same
time heard two more.</p>
<p>Mr. Farren, to whom I am indebted for the above information, has
kindly sent me the following drawing, made by his brother, from one of
the living specimens captured in the Forest.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a><i>Political Pieces and Songs relating to English History.</i> Edited by Thomas Wright. Vol. ii., p. 199.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>It is worth noticing how, according to their natures, our English
poets have dwelt upon the meaning of the woods, from Spenser, with his
allegories, to the ballad-singer, who saw them only as a preserve for deer.
Shakspeare touches upon them with both that joyful gladness, peculiar to
him, and the deep melancholiness, which they also inspire. Shelley and
Keats, though in very different ways, both revel in the woods. To Wordsworth
they are &ldquo;a map of the whole world.&rdquo; Of course, under the names
of woods, and any lessons from them, I speak only of such lowland woods
as are known chiefly in England; not dense forests shutting out light and
air, without flowers or song of birds, whose effect on national poetry and
character is quite the reverse to that of the groves and woodlands of our
own England. See what Mr. Ruskin has so well said on the subject.
<i>Modern Painters</i>, vol. v., part vi., ch. ix., &sect; 15, pp. 89, 90; and, also in
the same volume, part vii., chap. iv., &sect; 2, 3, pp. 137-39; and compare
vol. iii., part iv., ch. xiv., &sect; 33, pp. 217-19.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>In the lower part of the Forest, near the Channel, the effect is
quite painful, all the trees being strained away from the sea like
Tennyson&rsquo;s thorn. It is the <i>Usnea barbata</i> which covers them, especially
the oaks, with its hoary fringe, and gives such a character to the whole
Forest.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The reader must bear in mind that the word &ldquo;forest&rdquo; is here used,
as it is always throughout the district, in its primitive sense of a wild,
open space. And the moors and plains are still so called, though there
may not be a single tree growing upon them. (See chap. iii., <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>, foot-note.)
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>The woods, in <i>Domesday</i>, are, as we shall see, generally valued by
the number of swine they maintain.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>For a justification of this general picture, I must refer the reader to
the next chapter, where references to <i>Domesday</i>, as to the state of the district
before its afforestation by the Conqueror, and the evidence supplied
by the names of places, are given. I may add, as showing the former
nature of the woods, that the charcoal found in the barrows, embankments,
and the Roman potteries, is made from oak and beech, but principally
the latter. Since, too, the deer have been destroyed, young shoots of
holly are springing up in all directions, and another generation may,
perhaps, see the Forest resembling its old condition. As a proof, beside
the entry in <i>Domesday</i>, that the Hordle Cliffs were covered with timber,
the fishermen dredging for the <i>septaria</i> in the Channel constantly drag up
large boles of oaks, locally known as &ldquo;mootes.&rdquo; The existence of the
chestnut is shown by the large beams in some of the old Forest churches,
as at Fawley; but none now exist, except a few, comparatively modern,
though very fine, at Boldrewood. Further, the Forest could never, except
in the winter, have been very swampy, as the gravelly formation of the
greater part of the soil supplies it with a natural drainage. Still, there
were swamps, and in the wet places large quantities of bog-oak have been
dug up, bearing witness, as in other countries, of an epoch of oaks, which
preceded the beech-woods. Gough, in his additions to Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>,
vol. i., p. 126, describes Godshill as being in his day covered with thick
oaks. When, too, Lewis wrote in 1811, old people could then recollect
it so densely covered with pollard oaks and hollies that the road was easily
lost. (<i>Historical Enquiries on the New Forest</i>, p. 79, Foot-note.) No one, I
suppose, now believes that wolves were extirpated by Edgar. They and wild
boars are expressly mentioned in the Laws of Canute (<i>Manwood: a Treatise of
the Lawes of the Forest</i>, <i>f.</i> 3, &sect; 27, 1615), and lingered in the north of England
till Henry VIII.&rsquo;s reign. (See further on the subject, <i>The Zoology of Ancient
Europe</i>, by Alfred Newton, p. 24.) I have hesitated, however, to include
the beaver, though noticed by Harrison, who wrote in 1574, as in his time
frequenting the Taf, in Wales (<i>Description of England</i>, prefixed to Holinshed&rsquo;s
<i>Chronicle</i>, ch. iv. pp. 225, 226.) The eggs of cranes, bustards, and bitterns,
were, we know, protected as late as the middle of the sixteenth century.
(<i>Statutes of the Realm</i>, vol. iii., p. 445, 25<sup>o</sup> Henry VIII., ch. xi., &sect; 4; and
vol. iv., p. 109, 3<sup>o</sup>, 4<sup>o</sup>, Ed. VI., ch. vii.) The last bustard was seen in the
Forest, some twenty-five years ago, on Butt&rsquo;s Plain, near Eyeworth. It is
a sad pity that the enormous collection of birds&rsquo; bones, described as chiefly
those of herons and bitterns, found by Brander amongst the foundations of
the Priory Church at Christchurch (see <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. iv., pp. 117, 118),
were not preserved, as they might have yielded some interesting results.
We must, however, still bear in mind that there are far more points of
resemblance than of difference between the Forest of to-day and that of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s time; especially in the long tracts of fern and heath and furze,
which certainly then existed, pastured over by flocks of cattle.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a><i>Remarks on Forest Scenery, illustrated by the New Forest</i>, vol. ii.,
pp. 241-46; third edition. Some mention should here be made of Gilpin,
a man who, in a barren, unnatural age, partook of much of the same spirit
as Cowper and Thompson, and whose work should be placed side by side
with their poems. Unfortunately, much of his description is now quite
useless, as the Forest has been so much altered; but the real value of the
book still remains unchanged in its pure love for Nature and its simple,
unaffected tone. It is well worth, however, noticing&mdash;as showing the
enormous difficulty of overcoming an established error&mdash;that, notwithstanding
his true appreciation of bough-forms (see vol. i., pp. 110-12, same
edition), and his hatred of pollarded shapes, and all formalism (same vol.,
p. 4), he had not sufficient force to break through the conventional drawing
of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, and his
trees (see, as before, pp. 252-54) are all drawn under the impression that
they are a gigantic species of cabbage. The edition, however, published in
1834, and edited by Sir T. D. Lauder, is, in this and many other respects,
far better.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>The following measurements may have, perhaps, an interest for some
readers:&mdash;Girth of the Knyghtwood oak, 17 ft. 4 in.; of the Western oak
at Boldrewood, 24 ft. 9 in.; the Eastern, 16 ft.; and the Northern, in the
thickest part, 20 ft. 4 in.; though, lower down, only 14 ft. 8 in.; beech at
Studley, 21 ft.; beech at Holmy Ridge, 20 ft. The handsomest oak, however,
in the district, stands a few yards outside the Forest boundary, close
to Moyle&rsquo;s Court, measuring 18 ft. 8&frac12; in.

to other princes.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>Voltaire was the first to throw any doubt on the generally received
account (<i>Essai sur les M&oelig;urs et l&rsquo;Esprit des Nations</i>, tom. iii. ch. xlii.
p. 169. <i>Panth&eacute;on Litt&eacute;raire.</i> Paris, 1836). He has in England been followed
by Warner (<i>Topographical Remarks on the South-Western Parts of
Hampshire</i>, vol. i. pp. 164-197), and Lewis, in his <i>Historical Enquiries
concerning the New Forest</i>, pp. 42-55.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Concerning the King&rsquo;s prerogative to make a forest wherever he

exclusively his and his alone, see Manwood&mdash;<i>A Treatise of the Lawes of the
Forest</i>, ch. ii. ff. 25-33, and ch. iii. sect. i. f. 33, 1615. We must remember,
too, that, before the afforestation, William not only owned by right of
conquest, as being King, the large demesne lands of the Crown in the
district, and also those estates of former possessors, who had fallen at
Hastings, or fled into exile, but, as we know from <i>Domesday</i>, kept some&mdash;as
at Eling, Breamore, and Ringwood&mdash;in his own hands.

is as well to give the most unfavourable account. Spotswood, in his <i>History
of the Church of Scotland</i> (book ii. p. 30, fourth edition, 1577), repeats the

been more or less afforested, such as Godric (probably Godric Malf) at
Wootton, Willac in the hundred of Egheiete, Uluric at Godshill, in the
actual Forest, and Wislac at Oxley. See <i>Domesday</i> under the words
Odetune, Godes-manes-camp, and Oxelei, p. xxix. b. See, also, under

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_28" href="#fr_28">[28]</a>Passing over the later and more highly-coloured accounts, we will
content ourselves with Florence of Worcester, as more trustworthy, whose
words are&mdash;&ldquo;Antiquis enim temporibus, Edwardi scilicet Regis, et aliorum
Angli&aelig; Regum predecessorum ejus, h&aelig;c regio incolis Dei et ecclesiis
nitebat uberrime.&rdquo; (Thorpe&rsquo;s edition, as before quoted.) Were this, even
in a limited degree, true, the Forest would present the strange anomaly of
possessing more churches then than it does now, with a great increase
of population. The <i>Domesday</i> census, we may add, makes the inhabitants of
that portion which is called &ldquo;In Nov&acirc; Forest&acirc; et circa eam,&rdquo; a little over
two hundred. See Ellis&rsquo;s <i>Introduction to Domesday</i>, vol. ii. p. 450.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_29" href="#fr_29">[29]</a>In support of these statements, I may quote from the Prize Essay on
the Farming of Hampshire, published in the <i>Journal of the Royal Agricultural
Society of England</i> (vol. xxii., part ii., No. 48, 1861), and which
was certainly not written with any view to historical evidence, but simply
from an agricultural point. At pp. 242, 243, the author says: &ldquo;The outlying
New Forest block consists of more recent and unprofitable deposits.
This tract appears to the ordinary observer, at first sight, to be a mixed
mass of clays, marls, sands, and gravels. The apparent confusion arises
from the variety of the strata, from the confined space in which they are
deposited, and from the manner in which, on the numerous hills and knolls,
they overlie one another, or are concealed by drift gravel.&rdquo; And again, at
pp. 250, 251, he continues: &ldquo;Of the Burley Walk, the part to the west of
Burley Beacon, and round it, is nothing but sand or clay growing rushes,
with here and there some &lsquo;bed furze.&rsquo;... The Upper Bagshots,
about Burley Beacon, round by Rhinefield and Denney Lodges, and so on
towards Fawley, are hungry sands devoid of staple:&rdquo; and finally sums up
by saying, &ldquo;half of the 63,000 acres are not worth 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an acre,&rdquo; p. 330.

was made. This is a mistake. It was, however, built soon after, as we
know from some grants of Baldwin de Redvers.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a>Mr. Thorpe notices, in his edition of <i>The Chronicle</i>, vol. ii. p. 94, foot-note,
its early use, in a document of Eadger&rsquo;s, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 964, in the sense of a
town; but in the first place it certainly meant only an inclosed spot. There
appears to have been at some time, in the south part of the Forest, a church
near Wootton, the Odetune of <i>Domesday</i>, where its memory is still preserved
in the name of Church Lytton given to a small plot of ground. Rose, in
his notes to the <i>Red King</i>, p. 205, suggests that Church Moor and Church
Place indicate other places of worship. Church Moor is a very unlikely
situation, being a large and deep morass, and could well, from its situation,
have been nothing else, and, in all probability, takes its name, in quite
modern times, from some person. But Church Place at Sloden, like Church
Green in Eyeworth Wood, is certainly merely the embankments near which
the Romano-British population employed in the Roman potteries, once
lived, and which ignorance and superstition have turned into sacred ground.
The word Lytton, at Wootton, however, makes the former position certain,
but by no means necessitates that the church was standing at the afforestation.
Thus we know that in Leland&rsquo;s time a chapel was in existence at
Fritham (<i>Itinerary</i>, ed. Hearne, vol. vi. f. 100, p. 88), which has since his
day disappeared. It would, of course, be absurd to argue that all ruins
which have been, or yet may be found, were caused by the Conqueror.
Further, with regard to the castles, had there been any, they would most
certainly have been noticed in <i>Domesday</i>, and it is most unlikely, knowing
how very few existed in England at the Conquest, that five or six should
have been clustered together in the Forest. The fact, too, of Rose&rsquo;s
finding &ldquo;minute fragments of brick and mortar,&rdquo; lumps of chalk, and
pieces of slate bored with holes, simply proves that persons have, subsequently
to the Normans, found the New Forest a most ungrateful soil.
I may, perhaps, add that Mr Akerman, the well-known arch&aelig;ologist,
when, a few years since, exploring the Roman potteries in the Forest
(for which see chapter <a href="#c18">xvii.</a>), in vain tried there, or in other parts, to find
any traces of old buildings. (<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. xxxv. p. 97.)

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_39" href="#fr_39">[39]</a>See Manwood, as before, ff. 1-5.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_40" href="#fr_40">[40]</a>In the Charta de Forest&acirc; of Canute (Manwood, f. 3, sect. 27)
mention is made in the forests of horses, cows, and wild goats which are
all protected; and from sect. 28 it is plain that, under certain limitations,
people might cut fuel. These, with other privileges, such as killing game
on their own lands (see sect. xxx. f. 4)&mdash;for, by theory, all game was the
King&rsquo;s&mdash;were compensations given to the forester for being
subject to Forest Law.</div>
<div class="fncont">Further, from the Charta de Forest&acirc; of Henry III. (Manwood, ff. 6-11),
we find that persons had houses and farms, and even woods, in the very
centre of the King&rsquo;s forests; and the charter provides that they may there,
on their own lands, build mills on the forest streams, sink wells, and dig
marl-pits, referring, most probably, in the last case, to the New Forest,
where marl has been used, from time immemorial, to manure the land; and,
further, that in their own woods, even though in the forest, they might
keep hawks, and go hawking. (See f. 7, sects. xii., xiii.)</div>
<div class="fncont">It shows, too, that there was a population who gained their livelihood,
as to this day, by huckstering, buying and selling small quantities of timber,
making brushes, and dealing in bark and coal, which last article evidently
points to the Forest of Dean. (F. 7, sect. xiv.)</div>
<div class="fncont">We must not imagine that the Charta de Forest&acirc; of Henry III. was
entirely a series of new privileges. They were, with some notable exceptions,
simply those rights which had been received from the earliest times
in compensation for some of the hardships of the Forest Laws, and which
had been wrested away, probably by Richard or John, but which had
never been granted to those who dwelt outside the Forest. (On this point see
especially &ldquo;Ordinatio Foreste,&rdquo; 33rd Edward I., <i>Statutes of the Realm</i>, vol. i.
p. 144. And again, &ldquo;Ordinatio Foreste,&rdquo; 34th Edward I., sect. vi., same
volume, p. 149, where the rights of pasturage are re-allowed to those who
have lost it by the recent perambulation made in the twenty-ninth year of
the King&rsquo;s reign.)</div>
<div class="fncont">I think we may, therefore, gain from these clauses, especially when taken in
conjunction with those of the Charta de Forest&acirc; of Canute, a tolerably
correct picture of an ancient forest&mdash;that it consisted not merely of
large timber and thick underwood, a cover for deer, but of extensive plains,&mdash;still
here preserved in the various <i>leys</i>&mdash;grazed over by cattle, with here
and there cultivated spots, and homesteads inhabited by a poor, but industrious,
population.

in the preface, we have adopted for the limits of the book. A copy of the
original may be found in the <i>Journals of the House of Commons</i>, vol. xliv.,

these perambulations. From <i>Domesday</i>, it is certain that the Conqueror
afforested land on the west of the Avon at Holdenhurst, Breamore, and
Harbridge. And amongst the MSS of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Library we find a copy
of a charter of William of Scotland, dated, curiously enough, &ldquo;Hindhop
Burnemuth, in me&acirc; Nov&acirc; Forest&acirc;, 10 Kal. Junii, 1171.&rdquo; (See Hunter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>Three Catalogues</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c., p. 278, No. 78, 1838.) It would seem, from what
Edward&rsquo;s commissioners say, that these afforestations, which had taken place
since Henry II&rsquo;s time, were all made inside the actual boundaries of the
Forest. It has been generally supposed that the perambulation in the
eighth year of Edward I. was the first ever made of an English forest.
This is not the case, for in the Record Office, in the Plita Foreste de C&#333;m.

118,000 loads of timber; whilst in Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, in 1707, only
12,476 are reported as serviceable. See Fifth Report of the Land Revenue
Commissioners, <i>Journals of the House of Commons</i>, vol. xliv. p. 563. The
waste in James I.&rsquo;s and Charles I.&rsquo;s time must have been enormous, for from

Of the Forest Rights and Privileges, the secretary to the New Forest Commission
writes: &ldquo;The present state of the New Forest in this respect is
little less than absolute anarchy.&rdquo; (<i>Reports of Commissioners</i> (11), vol. xxx.
p. 357, 1850.) It should be distinctly understood, as was shown in the last
chapter, that these Rights had their origin as a compensation to those whose
lands had been afforested by the King, and who were, in consequence,
subject to the Forest Laws, and the injury done by the deer. Now that the
injury is no longer sustained, and the exercise of the Prerogative has ceased,
so ought also the privileges. The Crown, however, has not pressed this,
and the Rights are thus still enjoyed. <i>A Register of Decisions on Claims
to Forest Rights</i>, with each person&rsquo;s name, and the amount of his privileges,
was published in 1858.

year ending 31st of March, 1860, derived from the sale of timber, bark,
fagots, marl, and gravel, and rent of farms and cottages, &amp;c., were
23,125<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; whilst the expenses for labour, trees, carriage of timber,
and salaries, were 12,913<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; thus showing a considerable profit.
(From the Thirty-eighth Report of the Commissioners of her Majesty&rsquo;s
Woods and Forests.) The management of the Forest is now in the hands
of a deputy-surveyor, three assistants, and eight keepers; whilst four
verderers try all cases of stealing timber, turf, and furze.

the <i>Saxons in England</i>, vol. i., Appendix A, p. 481) for recognizing the Ancient
Mark. To the north lies Eling, the Mark of the Ealingas, and in regular
succession from it come the various hursts, holts, and dens, now to be seen
in Ashurst, Buckholt, and Dibden. The last village has a very picturesque
church, its roof completely thatched with ivy, disfigured, however, by a
wretched spire. In <i>Domesday</i> it possessed a saltern and a fishery, and a
wood with pannage for six hogs (sylva de 6 porcis). Two hydes were
taken into the Forest. Eling, at the same time, maintained two mills,
which paid twenty-five shillings, a fishery and a saltern, both free from
tax. The manor was bound, in the time of Edward the Confessor, to find
half-a-day&rsquo;s entertainment (<i>firma</i>) for the King. For a curious extract
from its parish register, see <a href="#c20">chapter xix.</a> Staneswood (Staneude), which
is more southward, also, according to <i>Domesday</i>, possessed a mill which
paid five shillings, and two fisheries worth fifty pence. Farther north lies
Redbridge, the Rodbrige of <i>Domesday</i>, which also maintained two mills,
rented, however, at fifty shillings. This was the Hreutford and Vadum
Arundinis of Bede, where lived Cynibert the Abbot, who, failing in his
attempt to save the two sons of Arvald from Ceadwalla, delayed their
death till he had converted them to Christianity. (Bede, <i>Hist. Eccl.</i>,
tom. i., lib. iv., cap. xvi., p. 284, published by the English Historical
Society.) All these places, with the exception of Redbridge, were more or
less afforested. The district, however, seems to have been by far the most
flourishing of any adjoining the New Forest, owing, no doubt, to the
immigration which the various creeks invited, and the remains of salterns
still show its former prosperity. Next to it came the Valley of the Avon,
its mills often rented, in <i>Domesday</i>, by a payment of the eels caught in
the river.

of the Forest in the twenty-ninth year of Edward I., which in
Charles II.&rsquo;s time is spelt Haythorneslade, thus losing its whole significance,

the fen and forest districts. Lincolnshire and Yorkshire can show plenty of
such steeples. At St. Michael&rsquo;s at York, to this hour, I believe, at six every

the great forest of Galtres; whilst at All Saints, in the Pavement, in

inches. Yew, seventeen feet. An enormous yew, completely hollow, however,
stands in Breamore churchyard, measuring twenty-three feet four
inches. There are certainly no yews in the Forest so large as these; and
their evidence would further show that at all events the Conqueror did not
destroy the churchyards. As here, too, there remains some Norman work
in the doorway of Breamore church.

me very admirable, though the position and meaning of the cloaked and

will doubtless, as the picture proceeds, become clear. The richness, however,
of the colouring can even now be seen under the enormous disadvantage
of being placed beneath the strong white glare of light which pours in
from the east window. Further, Mr. Leighton must be praised for his
boldness in breaking through the old conventionalities of Art, and giving us
here the owl as a symbol of sloth, and the wretchedness it produces.

who go into details, mentions the spot where the King was killed. The
<i>Chronicle</i> and Florence of Worcester most briefly relate the accident, though
Florence adds that William fell where his father had destroyed a chapel.
(Ed. Thorpe, vol. ii. p. 45). Henry of Huntingdon (<i>Historiarum</i>, lib. vii.,
in Saville&rsquo;s <i>Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum</i>, p. 378) says but little more,
dwelling only on the King&rsquo;s wickedness and the supernatural appearance of
blood. Matthew Paris brings a bishop on the scene, as explaining another
dream of the King&rsquo;s, and gives the King&rsquo;s speech of &ldquo;trahe arcum, diabole&rdquo;
to Tiril, which has a certain mad humour about it, as also the incident
of the tree, and the apparition of a goat (<i>Hist. Major. Angl.</i> Ed. Wats.,
pp. 53, 54), which are not to be found in <i>Roger of Wendover</i> (<i>Flores Hist.</i>
Ed. Coxe, tom. ii., pp. 157-59), and therefore open to the strongest suspicion.
Matthew of Westminster (<i>Flores Hist.</i> Ed. 1601, p. 235) follows,
in most of his details, William of Malmesbury. Simon of Durham (<i>De
Gestis Regum Anglorum</i>, in Twysden&rsquo;s <i>Historian Anglican&aelig; Scriptores Decem</i>,
p. 225), as, too, Walter de Hemingburgh (Ed. Hamilton, vol. i. p. 33),
and Roger Hoveden (<i>Annalium Pars Prior</i>, in Saville&rsquo;s <i>Rerum Anglicarum
Scriptores</i>, pp. 467, 468), copy Florence of Worcester. So, too, in various
ways, with all the later writers, who had access to no new sources of
information. Peter Blois, however, in his continuation of <i>Ingulph</i> (Gales&rsquo;s
<i>Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores</i>, tom. i. pp. 110, 111; Oxford, 1684) is more
vivid, and adds that the dogs were chasing the stags up a hill; but his
whole book is very doubtful, and his account in this particular instance is
irreconcilable with the others. Gaimar (<i>L&rsquo;Estorie des Engles.</i> Ed. Wright.
Caxton Society, pp. 217-224), who says that the King was hunting near
Brockenhurst (Brokehest), gives a still more detailed account, but we are
met by the same difficulties. Of later writers, Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i> (vol. vi.
f. 100, p. 88) states that the King fell at Thorougham, where in his time there
was still a chapel standing, evidently meaning Fritham, called Truham in
<i>Domesday</i>. Gilpin (<i>Forest Scenery</i>, vol. i. p. 166) mentions a similar tradition;
so that there is a very reasonable doubt as to the spot itself being where
the Stone stands, especially since, with the exception of the vague remark
of Florence, none of the best Chroniclers say one word about the place.
Thierry, in many minor particulars, follows Knyghton, whose authority is
of little value, and I have therefore omitted all reference to him.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_121" href="#fr_121">[121]</a>Very much against my inclination, I give a sketch of the iron case of
the Stone, which the artist has certainly succeeded in making as beautiful
as it is possible to do. The public would not, I know, think the book complete
without it. It stands, however, rather as a monument of the habit
of that English public, who imagine that their eyes are at their fingers&rsquo;
ends, and of a taste which is on a par with that of the designer of the post-office
pillar-boxes, than of the Red King&rsquo;s death, for the spot where he fell
is, as we have seen from the previous note, by no means certain. We must,
too, remember that there is no mention made by the Chroniclers of Castle
Malwood, but the context in Vitalis, as also the late hour mentioned by
Malmesbury when William went out to hunt, show that he was at the time
staying somewhere in the Forest.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_127" href="#fr_127">[127]</a>As I am not writing a History of England during this period, my
space will not permit me to enter into those details which, when viewed
collectively, carry so much weight in an argument; but at all events, it will
be well for some of my readers to bear in mind the character of William II.,
who in a recent work has lately been elevated into a hero. Without any
of his father&rsquo;s ability or power of statesmanship, he inherited all his vices,
which he so improved that they became rather his own. From having no
occupation for his mind, he sank more and more into licentiousness and
lust. (&ldquo;Omni se immunditi&acirc; deturpabat,&rdquo; is the strong expression of John
of Salisbury. <i>Life of Anselm</i>, part ii. ch. vii., in Wharton&rsquo;s <i>Anglia Sacra</i>,
tom. ii. p. 163. See, also, Suger, <i>Vita Lud. Grossi Regis</i>, cap. i., in Bouquet:
<i>Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la France</i>, tom. xii. p. 12. D. E.)
Being lustful, he naturally became cruel; not as his father was, on, at least,
the plea of necessity, but that he might enjoy a cultivated pleasure in gloating
over the sufferings of others. From being cruel, too, he became, in its
worst sense, an infidel; not from any pious scruple or deep conviction, but
simply that he might indulge his passions. (See that fearful story of the
trial of forty Englishmen told in Eadmer: <i>Hist. Nov.</i>, lib. ii., p. 48,
Ed. 1633, which illustrates in a twofold manner both his cruelty and his
atheism.)</div>
<div class="fncont">To a total want of eloquence he joined the most inveterate habit of
stammering, so that, when angry, he could barely speak. His physical
appearance, too, well harmonized with his moral and mental deformities.
His description reads rather like that of a fiend than of a man. Possessing
enormous strength, he was small, thick-set, and ill-shaped, having a large
stomach. His face was redder than his hair, and his eyes of two different
colours. His vices were, in fact, branded on his face. (Malmesbury,
Ed. Hardy, tom. ii., lib. iv., sect. 321, p. 504, whom I have literally
translated.)</div>
<div class="fncont">Let us look, too, at the events of his reign. Crime after crime crowds
upon us. His first act was to imprison those whom his father had set free.
He loaded the Forest Laws with fresh horrors. Impartial in his cruelty,
he plundered both castle and monastery (<i>The Chronicle</i>. Ed. Thorpe, vol. i.
p. 364). He burnt out the eyes of the inhabitants of Canterbury, who had
taken the part of the monks of St Augustin&rsquo;s. At the very mention of
his approach the people fled (Eadmer: <i>Hist. Nov.</i>, lib. iv. p. 94). Unable
himself to be everywhere, his favourites, Robert d&rsquo;Ouilly harried the
middle, and Odineau d&rsquo;Omfreville the north of England; whilst his
Minister, Ralph Flambard, committed such excesses that the people prayed
for death as their only deliverance (<i>Annal. Eccles. Winton.</i>, in Wharton&rsquo;s
<i>Anglia Sacra</i>, tom. i. p. 295).</div>
<div class="fncont">As <i>The Chronicle</i> impressively says, &ldquo;In his days all right fell, and all
wrong in the sight of God and of the world rose.&rdquo; Norman and English,
friend and foe, priest and layman, were united by one common bond of
hatred against the tyrant. It could only be expected that as his life was, so
his death would be; that he would be betrayed by his companions, and in
his utmost need deserted by his friends.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_131" href="#fr_131">[131]</a>Baxter, in his Preface to his <i>Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum</i>,
Ed. 1719, p. 12, entirely misquotes Alanus de Insulis (see <i>Prophetica
Anglicana Merlini Ambrosii cum septem libris explanationum Alani de
Insulis</i>. Frankfort, 1603. Lib. ii. pp. 68, 69), and completely misunderstands
the passage. Alanus, however (p. 69), seems to have no doubt that
the King fell by treachery,&mdash;&ldquo;spiculo invidi&aelig;,&rdquo; as was foretold by Merlin,
though he gives no other reason; and which by itself, resting on nothing
further, would carry no weight. His account, though, of the general
detestation of the Red King immediately before his death, as also the
conversation of Hugh, Abbot of Cluny, with Anselm (p. 68), is very suggestive,
especially by the way in which it is introduced. Alanus must
have possessed far too shrewd an intellect to have believed in Merlin;
though it might have suited his purpose to have appeared to have so done,
as a veil and a blind, so that he might better say what his high position
and authority would not in any other form have well permitted, but which
still give to many points, as here, enormous significance and weight.</div>
<div class="fncont">Besides Gaimar and Alanus, Nicander Nucius also hints at treachery
(<i>Second Book of Travels</i>, published by the Camden Society, pp. 34, 35),
but his account is too vague to be of any service. We should, however,
constantly bear in mind, with Lappenberg, that the best authority, <i>The
Chronicle</i>, simply relates that the King was shot at the chase by one
of his friends, without any allusion to an accident. Not one word or
fact else is given, except the appearance of a pool of blood in Berkshire
(at Finchhamstead, according to William of Malmesbury), which we
know, from other sources, was supposed to foretell some calamity, and
which phenomenon science now resolves into merely some species of
<i>alga</i>, probably either <i>Palmella cruenta</i> or <i>H&aelig;matococcus sanguineus</i>.
Eadmer, with some others, in his <i>Historia Novorum</i>, lib. ii. (Migne:
<i>Patrologi&aelig; Cursus Completus</i>, tom. clix. p. 422 B) mentions a report,
prevalent at the time, that the King accidentally stumbled on an arrow.
Then follows, in the very next book (Migne, as before, p. 423 B), a
singular passage, to be found also in his <i>Life of Anselm</i>, book ii. ch. vi.
(Migne, as before, tom. clviii. p. 108 D), where, on the news of the Red
King&rsquo;s death, Anselm bursts into tears, and, with sobs, cries, &ldquo;Quod si
hoc efficere posset, multo magis eligeret se ipsum corpore, quam illud, sicut
erat, mortuum esse.&rdquo; Whether this wish sprang from the effects of some
pangs of conscience as to William&rsquo;s death, or from an honourable feeling of
natural emotion under the circumstances, as suggested by Sharon Turner,
it is hard to determine. From John of Salisbury (<i>Vita Anselmi</i>, pars ii.,
cap. xi., in Wharton&rsquo;s <i>Anglia Sacra</i>, tom. ii. p. 169), it would seem that
Anselm thought that he was the direct cause, through God, of his death.
Wace, quoted by Sharon Turner (vol. iv. p. 169), says that a woman
prophesied to Henry his speedy accession to the throne; but I am not
inclined to put any faith in this story, especially as Wace&rsquo;s account is in
poetry, where a prophetical speech might after the event be given dramatically
true, without being so historically. The same criticism must be
applied to the still more detailed account of Gaimar, who vaguely accuses
Tiril of conspiracy. No one, however, was likely to declare, for so many
reasons, that the King was murdered. We must not expect such a statement,
or even look for it in the Chroniclers; we must seek for it in the
contradictions, and absurdities, and prophecies which have gathered round
the event.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_132" href="#fr_132">[132]</a>Let no one be startled at the fact of ecclesiastics being assassins. We
have on record during this very reign the deliberate confessions by monks
of plots to murder their abbots, deeming they were doing God a service.
We must further keep steadily in mind that prelates then united in their
own persons both sacred and military offices. How much Henry was under
the influence of the monasteries his marriage and his various appointments
show. Their power was enormous. In fact, I believe that the Conqueror
owed his success as much to them as Rufus his death, and Henry his
crown.

Rockbourne, and was held in demesne by the Conqueror, as it had also
been by Edward the Confessor. Two hydes and a half, and a wood
capable of supporting fifty swine, were taken into the Forest. From the
mention of a priest (<i>presbyter</i>), who received twenty shillings from some
land in the Isle of Wight, there may have been, though by no means

coast, the most flourishing district of any in the neighbourhood of the
Forest. It is worth, however, noticing that many of its mills were rented
not only by a money value, but by the additional payment of so many eels.
Thus at Charford (Cerdeford) the mill is rented at 15<i>s.</i> and 1,250 eels,
and at Burgate (Borgate) the mill paid 10<i>s.</i> and 1,000 eels, whilst at
Ibbesley (Tibeslei) the rental was only 10<i>s.</i> and 700 eels (<i>Domesday</i>, as
before, pp. xix. a, iv. b, xviii. a). The latter place had two hydes, and
Burgate its woods and pasture, which maintained forty hogs, taken into
the Forest; but Charford with its ninety-one acres of meadow-land, seems
not to have been afforested, which, taken with other instances, shows that
the best land was, as a rule, spared.

like that of all similar towns, is full of interest. It contains absolutions from
Archbishops to all those who assist in the good work of making bridges;&mdash;letters
from absolute patrons directing their clients which way to vote;&mdash;bonds
from others that they will not require any payment from the
burgesses, or put the borough to any expense;&mdash;old privileges of catching
eels and lampreys with &ldquo;lyer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hurdells de virgis,&rdquo; by all of which
the past is brought before us. So, too, the Chamberlain&rsquo;s Books are most
interesting. From them we can learn, year by year, the prices of wheat
and cattle, the fluctuation of wages, the average condition of the day,
and both the minutest outward events as also the innermost life of the
town. The true social history of England is written for us in our Chamberlain&rsquo;s
Books. They have unfortunately never been made use of as they
deserve. Thus let me give a few general quotations from those of Christchurch.
In 1578 lime was 6<i>d.</i> a bushel, from which price it fell within two
years to 2<i>d.</i> Stone for building we find about 1<i>s.</i> a ton. Wages then
averaged, for a skilled mechanic, from 7<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a day, and for a labourer,
4<i>d.</i>; whilst night-watchmen, in 1597, were only paid 2<i>d.</i> Timber, contrary
to what we should have expected, was comparatively dear. Thus
in 1588 we find 9<i>d.</i> paid for two posts, and 20<i>d.</i> for a plank and two posts,
whilst a few years afterwards a shilling is paid for making a new gate. Of
course in all these calculations we must bear in mind that money was then
three times its present value. Turning to other matters, we learn that in
1595, &ldquo;a pottle of claret wine and sugar&rdquo; cost 2<i>s.</i>, whilst a quart
of sack is only 12<i>d.</i> In 1582, a quart of &ldquo;whyte wine&rdquo; is 5<i>d.</i>, and twenty
years before this a barrel and a half of beer cost 4<i>d.</i> Again, in 1562, the
fourth year of Elizabeth, large salmon, whose weights are not specified,
appear to have averaged 7<i>d.</i> a piece. A load of straw for thatching came
to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and in some cases 3<i>s.</i>, which in 1550 had been as low as 8<i>d.</i>, and
never above 20<i>d.</i> Drawing it, or passing it through a machine, cost 4<i>d.</i>;
whilst a thatcher received 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for his labour of putting it on the roof.</div>
<div class="fncont">At the same time a load of clay, either for making mortar or for the actual
material of the walls, the &ldquo;cob,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pug&rdquo; of the provincial dialect, was
5<i>d.</i>, a price at which it had stood with some slight variations for many
years.</div>
<div class="fncont">To conclude, the smallest things are noted. Thus a thousand &ldquo;peats,&rdquo;
perhaps brought from the Forest, cost, in 1562, 15<i>d.</i>, whilst a load of
&ldquo;fursen,&rdquo; still the local plural of furse, perhaps also from the same place,
was 8<i>d.</i> Nothing in these accounts escapes notice. In 1586 a &ldquo;coking
stole,&rdquo; the well-known <i>cathedra stercoris</i>, the Old-English &ldquo;<i>scealfing-stol</i>,&rdquo;
is charged 10<i>d.</i>; whilst a collar, or, as it is elsewhere in the same book
called, &ldquo;an iron choker for vagabonds,&rdquo; cost 14<i>d.</i>

that in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign the captain received 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day; the officer under
him, 1<i>s.</i>; and the master-gunner and porter, and eleven gunners and ten
soldiers, 6<i>d.</i> each, which in Grose&rsquo;s time had been increased to 1<i>s.</i> (Grose&rsquo;s
<i>Antiquities</i>, vol. ii., where a sketch is given of the castle). Hurst, on account
of its strength, was to have been betrayed, in the Dudley conspiracy, to the
French, by Uvedale, Captain of the Isle of Wight. (Uvedale&rsquo;s Confession,
<i>Domestic MSS.</i>, vol. vii., quoted in Froude&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>, vol. vi.
p. 438.) Ludlow mentions the great importance of Hurst being secured to
the Commonwealth, as both commanding the Isle of Wight and stopping
communication with the mainland (<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 323). Hammond, in a
letter from Carisbrook Castle, June 25th, 1648, says it is &ldquo;of very great
importance to the island. It is a place of as great strength as any I know
in England&rdquo; (Peck&rsquo;s <i>Desiderata Curiosa</i>, vol. ii., b. ix., p. 383).

also from the letter of Colonel Hammond&rsquo;s deputies given in Rushworth
(vol. ii., part iv., p. 1351). Of Colonel Hammond&rsquo;s own treatment of
the King we learn from Charles himself, who, besides speaking of him as
a man of honour and feeling, said &ldquo;that he thought himself as safe in
Hammond&rsquo;s hands as in the custody of his own son&rdquo; (Whitelock, p. 321).

are full of interest, though they do not commence till after 1545, the
previous records being generally supposed to have been burnt by
D&rsquo;Annebault in one of his raids on the south coast. Du Bellay, however,
who, in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>, has so circumstantially narrated the French
movements, says nothing of Lymington having suffered, nor can I find the
fact mentioned in any of the State papers of the time. Take, for instance,
the following entries from the Chamberlain&rsquo;s books:&mdash;</div>
<table>
<tr><td>&ldquo;1643. </td><td>Quartering 20 soldiers one daie and night, going westward for the Parliam<sup>t</sup> service </td><td>xvi.<i>s.</i> </td><td>ij.<i>d.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td>1648. </td><td>For keeping a horse for the Lord General&rsquo;s man </td><td>iij.<i>s.</i> </td><td>x.<i>d.</i></td></tr>

<div class="fncont">Such entries to an historian of the period would be invaluable, as showing
not only the state of the country but of the town, when the town-chest had
to be sent four miles for safety; and proving, too, that here (notice the
fourth entry), as elsewhere, there were two nearly equally balanced factions&mdash;one
for the King, the other for the Commonwealth. I may add that a little
book has been privately printed, of extracts from the Lymington Corporation
books, from which the foregoing have been taken. It would be a very
good plan if those who have the leisure would render some such similar
service in other boroughs.

pp. 266, 269, 270, 278, of Mr. Warter&rsquo;s <i>Seaboard and the Down</i>. I hesitate
not to say that superstition in some sort or another is universal throughout
England. It assumes different forms: in the higher classes, just at present,
of spirit-rapping and table-turning, more gross than even those of the
lower; and I am afraid really seems constitutional in our English nature.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_200" href="#fr_200">[200]</a>Of the extreme difficulty of classification of race in the New Forest
I am well aware. I have, however, taken such typical families as Purkis,
Peckham, Watton, &amp;c., whose names are to be met in every part of the
Forest, as my guide. Often, too, certain Forest villages, as Burley and
Minestead, though far apart, have a strong connection with each other, and
a family relationship may be traced in all the cottages. A good paper
was read, touching upon the elements of the New Forest population, by
Mr. D. Mackintosh, before the Ethnological Society, April 3rd, 1861. Of
the Jute element, which we might have expected from Bede&rsquo;s account of
the large Jute settlement in the Isle of Wight, and Florence of Worcester&rsquo;s
language (as before, ed. Thorpe, vol. i., p. 276), few traces are to be found.

the preface (p. i.) to his <i>Glossary of Provincialisms in the County of
Sussex</i>. For instance, such Romance words as appleterre, gratten, ampery,
bonker, common in Sussex, are not to be heard in the Forest; whilst many
of the West-Country words, as they are called, used daily in the Forest, as
charm (a noise&mdash;see next chapter, <a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>), moot, stool, vinney, twiddle
(to chirp), are, if Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s Glossary is correct, quite unknown in
Sussex.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_209" href="#fr_209">[209]</a>It is surprising, in looking over the musters of ships in the reigns of
Edward II. and Edward III., to see how few Northern ports are mentioned.
The importance, too, of the South-coast ports, which were sometimes summoned
by themselves, arose not only from the reasons in the text, but from
being close to the country with which we were in a state of chronic warfare.
See, too, the <i>State Papers</i>, vol. i., p. 812, 813, where the levies of the fleets
in 1545, against D&rsquo;Annebault, with the names of each vessel and its port,
are given; as also p. 827, where the neighbouring coast of Dorset is
described as deserted, in consequence of the sailors flocking to the King&rsquo;s
service. I think that I have somewhere seen that our sailors were once
rated as English, Irish, Scotch, and the &ldquo;West Country,&rdquo; the latter
standing the highest.

used, showing what vitality, even when transplanted, there is in our

thirty yards in circumference, and three feet high in the centre, surrounded
by an irregular moat, from which the earth had been taken. This I opened
in 1862, driving a broad trench from the east to the centre, and another from
the south to the centre, which, as also the west side, we entirely excavated;
digging below the natural soil to the depth of four feet. Nothing, however,

more, known as the Nodes, the westernmost about one hundred yards in

being one hundred and fifty and one hundred yards. Two more stand on

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_241" href="#fr_241">[241]</a>This camp was probably, since coins of Claudius have been found there,
occupied by Vespasian, when he conquered the Isle of Wight. A bronze
celt was found here some eighty years ago, and came into the possession
of Warner. Others have been discovered, in great quantities, in various
parts of the Forest, two of which are engraved in <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. v.,
plate viii., figs. 9 and 10. Brander, too, the well-known antiquary, found
others at Hinton, on the west border of the Forest (<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. v.
p. 115). Mr. Drayson has also picked up two flint knives at Eyeworth,
which are figured, showing both the under and upper surfaces, at <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_242" href="#fr_242">[242]</a>As in Derbyshire all barrows are marked by the terminal low&mdash;<i>hl&oelig;w</i>,
a grave, so in the Forest they seem particularized by a reference to the
Old-English <i>lic</i>. Thus, near the Beaulieu barrows we find Lytton Copse
and Common, and at the west end of the Forest, not far from Amberwood,
meet another Latchmoor. I may notice that just outside the Forest,
in Darrat&rsquo;s Lane&mdash;a word which often occurs&mdash;we find a place, near some
mounds, called &ldquo;Brands,&rdquo; equivalent to the &ldquo;Brund&rdquo; of Derbyshire, and
having reference to the burning funeral pyre. (See Bateman&rsquo;s <i>Ten Years&rsquo;
Diggings</i>, Appendix, p. 290.)
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_243" href="#fr_243">[243]</a>I certainly think that these urns were fired, though imperfectly. As
Mr. Bateman remarks, sun-baked specimens soon return to their original
clay. See Appendix to <i>Ten Years&rsquo; Diggings</i>, p. 280.</div>
<div class="fncont">These three urns, with all the other fragments of cinerary vessels
found in the Forest, I have placed in the British Museum, where they
have been restored. The artist has represented them exactly as they
appeared on the second day of digging. The fractures in the central urn
were caused by an unlucky blow from a pick-axe. The measurements are
as follows:&mdash;</div>

</table>
<div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_244" href="#fr_244">[244]</a>I am inclined to think that here, as in the similar instance on Fritham
Plain, the urns were put in the mound entire, and not, as is sometimes the
case, in fragments. The pieces had no appearance of being burnt after
the fractures had taken place, which were here simply the result of decay.
See on this point Bateman&rsquo;s <i>Ten Years&rsquo; Diggings</i>, pp. 191, 192, where
Mr. Keller&rsquo;s letter to Sir Henry Ellis on the subject is given.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_245" href="#fr_245">[245]</a>Instances have been known where the top of a Roman cinerary urn
has been taken off, and replaced; but, from the narrowness of the neck, I
hardly think this vessel was used for such a purpose. I give with it also
a late British urn found, some twenty years ago, in a barrow outside the
present Forest boundary, in a field known as Hilly Accombs, near Darrat&rsquo;s
Lane, which has been previously mentioned. It measures 6 inches in height,
and has a circumference of 1 foot 9 inches round the top, and 1 foot at the
base. With it was discovered another, but I have been unable to learn in
whose possession it now is, or what has become of the Roman glass unguent
bottle found in Denney Walk (see the <i>Antiquities of the Priory of Christchurch</i>,
by B. Ferrey and E. W. Brayley, p. 2, foot-note). The two flint
knives were discovered by Mr. Drayson, near Eyeworth Wood, and somewhat
resemble the chipping found in the largest barrow at Bratley, and
were, perhaps, cotemporary. The conchoidal fracture may be well seen in
specimen on the right-hand side. The celts found by Warner and Brander,
with others in the possession of Gough, mentioned at <a href="#Page_199">p. 199</a>, foot-note, were
bronze.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_246" href="#fr_246">[246]</a>There are two large heathy tracts known as Fritham Plain; the one
to the east, where stand several large trenched barrows, which still remain
to be opened; and the West Plain, where these excavations took place.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_247" href="#fr_247">[247]</a>An attempt to examine this barrow had been previously made, but
the explorers had opened a little to the south-west of the spot where the
pottery lay. It is just possible that the large square in Sloden may be of
the same character. I cut a small opening at the western end, but it is
impossible, on account of the trees, to make any satisfactory excavation.
Whatever might have been its original purpose, it was certainly never the
site of a church, as is commonly supposed. See ch. iii., <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>, foot-note.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_248" href="#fr_248">[248]</a>To assist the arch&aelig;ologist, I have marked on the map the sites of all
the barrows of which I am aware. In the British Museum is a small urn,
found in a barrow at Broughton, on the borders of Hampshire, about
twelve miles north of the Forest, measuring three inches in height, and,
though so much less, somewhat resembling, with its two small ears, as also
in the general character and texture of its ware, those found in the Bratley
barrow. The Rev. J. Compton also informs me that some years ago a
plain urn was discovered in a barrow on his father&rsquo;s property at Minestead,
in the Forest. I hear, too, that other urns have been found in barrows near
Burley on the west, and near Butt&rsquo;s Ash Lane on the east side of the
Forest, but they have long ago been lost or destroyed, and I am unable
to learn even their general form. I trust, therefore, permission will not
be granted to open the mounds which are unexplored, except to those who
can produce some credentials that they are fitted for the task, and are
doing it from no idle curiosity, but legitimate motives. Too much harm
has been already done, and too many barrows have been already rifled,
without any record being made of their contents. Nearly all that we
know of Kelt or Old-English we learn from their deaths. Their history is
buried in their graves.

a list of the notices of the various discoveries of Keltic urns, scattered
through the different Arch&aelig;ological Journals and Collections, which will
save the student much time and labour. A most valuable paper on the
subject, by Kemble, was published in the <i>Arch&aelig;ological Journal</i> vol. xii.

near Wetton, Staffordshire,&rdquo; in Bateman&rsquo;s <i>Ten Years&rsquo; Diggings</i>, pp. 194-200.
I have never found any stone floors, but this may be accounted for
by the difficulty of procuring paving-stones in the district. The best guide
which I know for discovering any ancient settlements is the presence of
nettles and chickweed, which, like the American &ldquo;Jersey-weed,&rdquo; always
accompany the footsteps of man. These plants are very conspicuous in the
lower parts of Sloden, as also at the Crockle and Island Thorn potteries.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_252" href="#fr_252">[252]</a>The spot where these banks intersect each other is known as Sloden
Hole, and is well worthy of notice. The annexed plan will best show
the character of the place. The largest bank is that which runs
to the south-west, measuring four yards across, and proving by its
massiveness that it is a Roman work. Upon digging, as shown in
the plan, at the point of intersection, we found pieces of iron and
iron slag, sandstone, charcoal, and Roman pottery similar to that
made in Crockle. Many of these banks run for long distances. That
to the south-east reaches the top of Sloden Green, about half a mile off,
whilst the north-east bank stretches for nearly a mile to Whiteshoot. There
are, too, other banks scattered about Sloden, which, if examined, would
doubtless yield similar results, but none are so well defined as these. The
largest bank which I know in the district stretches from Pitt&rsquo;s Enclosure,
in a south-easterly direction across Anderwood, and so through the southern
parts of Sloden.</div>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_253" href="#fr_253">[253]</a>The
most noticeable specimens which I discovered were a strainer or
colander, a funnel, some fragments of &ldquo;mock Samian&rdquo; ware; part of a
lamp, with the holes to admit air, as also for suspension; and some beads
of Kimmeridge clay, proving, by being found here, their Roman origin.
The iron tools of the workmen had been dropped into the furnace, and
were a good deal melted. The wood owed its preservation to the ferruginous
soil in which it was imbedded, and was in a semi-fossilized state.
Nothing less slight than a plank could have lasted so long. The finger-marks
and impress of the hand were very plain on one of the masses of
brick-earth. The coin, I am sorry to say, is too much worn to be recognized.
These, with the other vessels, <i>pater&aelig;</i>, <i>urceoli</i>, <i>lagen&aelig;</i>,
<i>pocula</i>, <i>acetabula</i>,
&amp;c., I have placed in the British Museum, where is also Mr. Bartlett&rsquo;s
rich collection. The patterns, with the necks of <i>ampull&aelig;</i> and <i>gutti</i>, as also
the specimens at pages <a href="#Page_214">214</a>, <a href="#Page_225">225</a>, will, I trust, give some general idea of the
beauty of the ware, and can be compared with those given by Mr. Akerman
in <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. xxxv. p. 96, and by Mr. Franks in the <i>Arch&aelig;ological
Journal</i>, vol. x. p. 8. The commonest shape for a drinking-vessel is the
right-hand figure at <a href="#Page_225">page 225</a>, known in the Forest, from the depressions
made by the workman&rsquo;s thumb, as a &ldquo;thumb pot.&rdquo; Sometimes it is met
with considerably ornamented, and varies in height from three to ten inches.
The principal part of the pottery is slate-coloured and grey, and faint
yellow, but some of a fine red bronze and morone, caused by the overheating
of the ovens. The patterns are thrown up by some white pigment,
though a great many are left untouched by anything but the workman&rsquo;s
tool. When chipped, the ware, by being so well burnt, is quite siliceous.
This manufactory, as its size would show, was not confined to merely supplying
the wants of the immediate neighbourhood, but probably, with others
at Alice Holt and elsewhere, furnished a great part of the South of England
with its earthenware, for fragments of the same make, shape, and texture,
have been found at Bittern (Clausentum), and Chichester, though doubtless
a similarity of workmanship prevailed amongst many of the potteries. The
so-called crockery of the southern part of the Forest is nothing else but
the plates of turtles imbedded in the Freshwater marls.

but they were left here by the former inhabitants, and not made on the
spot. The place known as Church Green is evidently the site of a habitation.
In the autumn of 1862 I made several excavations; but there was
some difficulty attending the work, as the ground had been previously
explored by the late Mr. Lewis, the author of the <i>Historical Inquiries on
the State of the New Forest</i>. The evidence, however, of the Roman pottery
was sufficient to show its occupation during the Roman period, and to
dispel the illusion that it was ever the site of a church. On the north-east
side of the wood are the remains of a fine Roman camp, the <i>agger</i> and
<i>vallum</i> being in one place nearly complete.

Claudius Gothicus, found in various parts of the Forest, the last in one

the Crockle and Island Thorn Potteries were in their most flourishing

book containing the names of the owners of the different pews in the church
in 1672, invaluable to any local historian. In the beginning of this book are
inserted a number of law-forms of agreements, wills, and indentures, probably
for the use of the clergyman, who was, perhaps, consulted by his
parishioners in worldly as also spiritual matters. In the Register there is,

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_274" href="#fr_274">[274]</a>All these beds are shown in the large map by the word &ldquo;Fossils,&rdquo;
there not being space enough to particularize each bed.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_275" href="#fr_275">[275]</a>These beds were discovered by Mr. Fisher in 1861, and for the
following measurements I am indebted to Mr. Keeping. We find, about
one hundred yards in a south-eastward direction from the point where the
footpath from Brook to Fritham crosses the stream, (1) the Coral Bed,
the equivalent of that at Stubbington, full of crushed <i>Dentalia</i> and
<i>Serpul&aelig;</i>, six inches. (2) Sandy light blue clay, with very few fossils,
seven feet. (3) Verdigris-green and slate-coloured clay, characterized near
the top by a new species of <i>Dentalium</i>, <i>Serpulorbis Morchii</i> (?), and <i>Spondylus
rarispina</i>. The other typical shells are <i>Voluta Maga</i>, several species of
<i>Arca</i> and <i>Corbula gallica</i>, five feet. It is in this bed that large roots of
trees and ferns are found.</div>
<div class="fncont">No persons, however, I should suppose, would think of examining any
of these beds without first consulting Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s most valuable paper on
the Bracklesham Beds in the <i>Proceedings of the Geological Society</i>, May,
1862. And I should further most strongly advise them, if they wish to
become practically acquainted with the beds, to procure the assistance of
Mr. Keeping, of Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight.</div>
<div class="fncont">I may here also mention that a well is at the present moment being
sunk at Emery Down, and which, as I learn from Mr. Keeping, gives the
following interesting measurements:&mdash;(1) Beds of marl, containing <i>Voluta
geminata</i>, discovered forty years ago, at Cutwalk Hill, by Sir Charles Lyell,
and now re-discovered, and a small <i>Marginella</i>, seven feet. (2) Bed of
bluish sandy clay, which becomes, when weathered, excessively brown.
This bed, very rich in fossils, which are in a good state of preservation, is
equivalent to what is now called the Middle Marine Bed, at Hordle and
Brockenhurst, sixteen to nineteen feet. (3) Hordle Freshwater Beds, containing
two species of <i>Potanomya</i>, and comminuted shells, fifteen feet. (4)
Upper Bagshot Sands, measuring, as far as the workmen have gone, twenty
feet, and below which lies the water at the top of the clay. The important
point to be noticed is the extreme thinning out of the Hordle Freshwater
Beds, which, from the depth of two hundred and fifty feet at Barton, have
here shrunk to fifteen. Mr. Prestwich has suggested that these beds, as
they advance in a north-easterly direction, become more marine, which seems
here to be confirmed.

the artist. But the specimens were obliged to be so greatly reduced, that
the drawing gave no complete idea of their form and beauty, and would
only have confused the reader. I have, therefore, contented myself with
figuring at <a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>, in its matrix of clay, the rare <i>Natica cepacea</i> (?), which
has passed into Mr. Edwards&rsquo; fine collection, and who has kindly allowed
me the use of it, with the characteristic <i>Cassidaria nodosa</i>, and a lovely
<i>Calyptr&aelig;a trochiformis</i>, found, as mentioned, inside a <i>Cardita</i>. At <a href="#Page_244">p. 244</a>,
the specimens given from the Shepherd&rsquo;s Gutter Beds are <i>Cerithium
trilinum</i> (Edw. <i>MS.</i>), <i>Voluta uniplicata</i>, and, in the centre, a shell, showing
oblique folds on the <i>columella</i>, which Mr. Edwards thinks may be identical
with <i>Fusus incertus</i> of Deshayes.

to whether our tame pigs are descended from the European Wild Boar.
(See <i>Proceedings of the Zoological Society</i>, 1861, p. 264; and <i>Annals
and Magazine of Natural History</i>, Third Series, vol. ix. p. 415.) Certain
it is that here are some breeds distinct in their markings. I must
not, too, forget to mention <i>Coronella l&aelig;vis</i> (Boie), which is found in the
Forest, as also in Dorsetshire and Kent. This is the <i>Coronella austriaca</i>
of Laurenti, and afterwards the <i>Coluber l&aelig;vis</i> of Lac&eacute;pede. It might
be mistaken for the common viper (<i>Pelias berus</i>), but differs in not being
venomous, as also from the ringed snake (<i>Natrix torquata</i>) in having
a fang at the hinder extremity of its jaws, the peculiarity of the genus
<i>Coronella</i>. It feeds on lizards, which its fang enables it to hold; drinks a
great deal of water; and Dr. G&uuml;nther, of the British Museum, to whom I
am indebted for the above information, tells me that it crawls up the furze
and low bushes to lick the rain off the leaves. For a list of the Lepidoptera
of the New Forest, see <a href="#c27">Appendix IV.</a>

<div class="fncont">With these weights may be compared the following:&mdash;Egg, supposed to
be that of a merlin, taken with two others which were broken, June 17th,
1862, near Alum Green, in the hole of a beech, rather sat upon, weighed
4dr. 1sc. 10gr. Two fresh-laid eggs of kestrels, taken at the same time,
weighed 4d. 2sc. 15gr. Other eggs of kestrels, however, have weighed considerably
more; and two others, also laid about the same time, came to
5dr. 5 gr.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_286" href="#fr_286">[286]</a>As the instances of the breeding of the merlin, especially under these
circumstances, will always be very rare, I may as well add my own personal
observations. In the spring of 1861 I received three eggs taken not far
from the Knyghtwood Oak, and said to have been found in the hole of a
beech. As I am not in the habit of paying any attention to the mere stories
which are so plentiful, I did not, therefore, examine them with any attention,
and put them aside as merely kestrel&rsquo;s. After, however, Mr. Farren&rsquo;s
communication to me, I looked out particularly for this little hawk, but
only once saw it in the open ground, near Warwickslade Cutting, from
whence it flew up, perching for a moment on a holly, and then making off
to the woods. On June 4th, however, I observed a hen bird fly out of a
hole, about twenty feet from the ground, in an old beech in Woolstone&rsquo;s
Hill, on the east side of Haliday&rsquo;s Hill Enclosure. There were, however,
no eggs. On the 5th I went again, and the bird, when I was about
fifty yards from the tree, again flew off. Still, there were no eggs. I
did not return till the 9th, when the nest, now pulled out of the
hole, had been robbed. It was made of small sticks, and a considerable
quantity of feather-moss, and some fine grass, and in general character resembled
the nests of the bird found by Mr. Hewitson in Norway. In the
holes were the bones of young rabbits, but these had, from their bleached
appearance, been brought by a brown owl, who had reared her brood there
in the previous summer. I afterwards learnt where the three eggs had been
taken in 1861; but there was nothing, with the exception of a few sticks, in
the hole, which was in this case about ten feet from the ground, and placed
also in a beech on the edge of Barrowsmoor. Great caution, however, must
be exercised regarding the merlin&rsquo;s eggs; for I am inclined to think that the
kestrel, contrary to its usual practice, sometimes also breeds in the Forest
in the holes of trees. The egg mentioned at <a href="#Page_264">p. 264</a>, foot-note, brought to
me on June 17th, 1862, I have every reason to believe is a merlin&rsquo;s, but
could not quite satisfy myself as to the evidence.

<br /><i>His Birthplace and its Neighbourhood.</i></b></p>
<p class="tbcenter"><b>Selection from Notices by the Press.</b></p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Westminster Review.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;A most elegant volume. Artist, printer, and author have vied with each other in
its production. All the well-known spots are taken from their most favourable points
of view, and engraved with a skill for which Mr. Linton&rsquo;s name is a sufficient guarantee.
Mr. Wise is peculiarly fitted for his task. He revels in painting the beauties of
his native county with an enthusiastic admiration, in which he makes Shakspere
share, by the readiness with which he localises descriptions in the poet&rsquo;s works that
would have no such home-like effect on an ordinary reader. He does this, too, without
any arbitrary forcing, and gives a new grace to the character of the universally
beloved poet by connecting him by hitherto unobserved ties with the home of his youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Spectator.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;A critical biography of the one supreme poet of humanity; written with skill, discrimination,
and taste.... Mr. Wise notices in a reverent spirit, and in
soberly elegant language, the intellectual talents, the imperial diction and gorgeous
colouring, the knowledge, the wisdom, imagination, and many-sidedness of this wonderful
artist; but he lays even more stress on Shakspere&rsquo;s moral characteristics, and on
the effectual qualities of his nature, than on these more brilliant and obvious endowments;
on his genial humour, his universal sympathy and tolerance, his serene hilarity,
his robust simple-hearted patriotism, and his love of freedom&mdash;freedom of speculation,
freedom of discussion. The essential goodness of our great poet is the main
argument of Mr. Wise&rsquo;s discourse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Daily News.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;We find the book as good as it is pretty, and therefore twice worthy commendation.
We have to thank Mr. Wise for a glossary which not only explains the provincialisms
of Shakspere, but, <i>&egrave; converso</i>, gives a Shaksperian colour to phrases in use among the
Warwickshire peasantry to this day. So delightfully readable a glossary as this we
have seldom encountered.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Morning Herald.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Wise has treated an old and well-worn subject with singular good sense and
taste.... The chapter on Shakspere himself is a sound and masterly examination
of the nature and spirit of his genius, as revealed in his works. Mr. Wise has a
voice of his own in the matter, and it is well worth listening to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="sc">The Lake Country</span>, by Mrs. Linton, is the best description of that part of
England ever published.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Illustrated London News.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Its exterior is noble, and its interior, studded with many a glorious illustration,

<p>&lsquo;A highly attractive and thoroughly enjoyable work.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Athen&aelig;um.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one can leave Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s book without being informed of much that
is curious as well as valuable concerning times past. To the Tourist, who knows
the Lakes, this book will be welcome, not only for its text, but on account of the
charming drawings with which Mr. Linton has done his best&mdash;a very happy
best&mdash;to recall many lovely and famous scenes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The Examiner.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Book of <span class="sc">The Lake Country</span> is, in every picture, visibly the work of
an artist who, whether in large plates or in small sketches, endeavours to represent
the soul and life of English scenery, under some of its most picturesque
and attractive aspects. Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s book, were it not illustrated as it is, or
printed luxuriously, would indeed win attention and credit, as a careful and
interesting monograph of one of the most interesting districts in the kingdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">The London Review.</span>)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s literary sketches are full of true feeling for the country they
portray, and in imparting the writer&rsquo;s own animation to the reader, bring before
his mental vision the glory and the gloom, the majesty and the beauty, the
pathos and the power, the loveliness and the desolation, of the mountains, lakes,
and moors of Cumberland and Westmoreland. Of Mr. Linton&rsquo;s designs we cannot
speak too highly. They are drawn and engraved with the hand of a
master, and bring before our vision, with exquisite truth and feeling, all the
rugged beauty of the land they commemorate.&rsquo;</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
